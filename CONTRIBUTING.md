# Contributing

Everyone involved in [Carpentry@UiO](https://governance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](https://governance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#code-of-conduct).

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to [create an issue](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/issues)
to tell us about a spelling mistake,
some awkward wording,
or a factual error.
This is a good way to introduce yourself
and to meet some of our community members.

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account,
    you can [send us comments by email](mailto:contact-us@swcarpentry.uio.no).
    However,
    we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

2.  If you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account,
    or are willing to [create one](https://github.com/join),
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/issues).
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git,
    and would like to add or change material,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).
    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub,
you may want to look at
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
In brief:

1.  We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:
    1.  Fork the repository into your account and clone it to your desktop
    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop clone of your fork for each significant change
    2.  Commit the change in that branch
    3.  Push that branch to your fork of the repository on GitHub
    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to [this repository](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational)
    5.  If you receive feedback,
        make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub -
        the pull request will update automatically.

2.  The published copy of the material is in the `master` branch of [this repository](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational)
    1. Please keep the master branch of your fork up to date with the one from [this repository](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational)
    2. Create all branches from that up to date master branch in your fork
    3. Please do *not* work directly in your fork's `master` branch,
    since that will make it difficult for you to work on other contributions

The Carpentry@UiO coordinators as well as some community volunteers
will review issues and pull requests
or encourage others to do so.
The people are community volunteers,
and have a final say over what gets merged into the lesson.
