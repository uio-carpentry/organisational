## Workshop evaluation

### Spring semester
In the Spring semester workshops, participants appreciated the thorough coverage of basics in spreadsheets and R, the friendly atmosphere, and the knowledgeable instructors. The structured, step-by-step approach and the availability of immediate assistance were highlighted as major strengths. The workshops were also commended for their suitable pace and starting from the basics.

However, attendees suggested improvements such as more information on applications, spreading the content over three days for a better pace, higher-level workshops, and more comprehensive material coverage. A pre-session for technical setup and slower pacing in certain sections were also recommended.

Instructors and helpers were praised for their effective problem-solving support and clear explanations, especially for non-intuitive coding aspects. While the workshops were well-received for their beginner-friendly approach, there was a desire for advanced content and better preparatory resources.

### Fall semester workshops
Participants really liked the hands-on approach and how easy it was to learn different tasks, especially in bash and Python. They appreciated the interactive sessions, the immediate help available, and the encouragement to ask questions.

However, they suggested some improvements: including more advanced topics, making the learning environment more comfortable, adding more challenging tasks, and extending the workshop duration to cover the material more thoroughly, especially for beginners. Overall, the feedback was very positive, with strong support for continuing these courses.

## Social events

### TO DO FOR 2025 NOTES

* When sending the post-workshop survey send also link to DSC newsletter 

* Continue to open the courses for a number greater than the actual capacity, this helps to prevent low turn-out even when people deregister. 

* When sending out reminder emails (1 week before workshop) add that there is a waitlist, asking people to please deregister if they do not intend on attending, this also helps to prevent low turn-out.

 * Course information needs to be made more visible for the participants in the site and sending an e-mail with set-up instructions in advance

* Make a recurrent social event for the community (once a month) 

* The Board should host information meetings of some form for new Carpentry@UiO members

##### Email Templates (all can be found in the Teams Carpentry@UiO folder):	

* Continue to send a reminder email to registered participants one-week before the workshop. 

* Continue to send a reminder email to registered participants with the pre-workshop survey 2 days before the workshop. 

* Continue to send a post-workshop email to registered participants immediately after the workshop, including the post-workshop survey link.
