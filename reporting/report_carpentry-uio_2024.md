### TO DO FOR 2025 NOTES
* Continue with the following suggestions from 2024:
    * When sending the post-workshop survey send also link to DSC newsletter 

    * Continue to open the courses for a number greater than the actual capacity, this helps to prevent low turn-out even when people deregister. 

    * When sending out reminder emails (1 week before workshop) add that there is a waitlist, asking people to please deregister if they do not intend on attending, this also helps to prevent low turn-out.

    * Course information needs to be made more visible for the participants in the site and sending an e-mail with set-up instructions in advance

    * Make a recurrent social event for the community (once a month) 

    * The Board should host information meetings of some form for new Carpentry@UiO members

* Work to revive Study Groups aiming for 4 meetings a semester
