# Organisational

This folder contains important information for running self organised Carpentries-workshops and similar workshops at UiO.

It contains reports on our activities and serves as an archive for our community and board meetings minutes and related materials. See also our new [Wheel of the year](YearWheel.png).

If you are an instructor or co-instructor for a workshop, please consult the [onboarding checklist](workshop-operations/onboarding-checklist.md)!
