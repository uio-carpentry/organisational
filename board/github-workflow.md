# Workflow for Carpentry@UiO Board Maintained GitHub Repositories [organisational](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational), [board](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/board), [governance](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/governance)


## Meeting minutes

1. Agree who will be taking notes during the meeting
2. Best practice: Write the minutes in the Carpentry@UiO HackMD team space (e.g. copying [this template](https://hackmd.io/G0oWROxTRtqkwiMcDJ63Nw)), observing [the meeting minutes guidelines](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/tree/master/meetings#readme)
4. Give the meeting members sufficient time to review the minutes
5. Push the minutes to the uio-carpentry/organisational repo (procedure described [here](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Flink-with-github)), with file name ``meetings/YYMMDD_whosmeeting.md`` -> **Secretary** task for board meetings
6. [Add a GitHub badge to the notes in HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Flink-with-github#Add-GitHub-badge) to link the documents, and push the update.

## Issues

- Carpentry@UiO has three repositories dedicated to organisation and coordination of the local community, the work of the Board, and the governance documents
- everyone can comment, ask questions, make suggestions, etc. to all repositories. Read [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to familiarize yourself with how to do that
- We use Issues for our workflow
  - Actions Points from meeting minutes and other organisational documents get turned into Issues
  - each new Issue is assigened to one or more Board members
  - each new Issue that is for the Board to handle is assigned the project "Board"
  - when updating/editing a document, create a Pull-Request and refer to the Issue in the commit message
  - when an Issue is completed, close it; it will be automatically moved into "Done" in the Kanban project management
  - when adding Action Points to meeting minutes and other documents, use the checkbox ```- [ ]``` for a new Action Point and the checked checkbox ```- [x]``` for completed Action Points
