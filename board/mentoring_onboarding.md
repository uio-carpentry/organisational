# Mentoring Carpentries instructor trainees - a brief guide for Carpentry@UiO

## Goal

We want our trainees to become certified Carpentries instructors so they can teach at official Software, Data, and Library Carpentry workshops here in Oslo, in Norway, and the World.

In order for a trainee to "checkout", they need to have participated actively in the 2-day instructor training and they must complete three tasks within a period of 90 days after the successfully attended instructor training.

These three tasks include:

1. Participation in an online discussion session
2. A contribution to the Carpentries material
3. A teaching demonstration

They do not have to be completed in a specific order, though.

## 1. Participation in an online discussion

- Carpentries hosts so-called discussion sessions regularly, usually several times per month
- Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions
- the trainee is expected to sign up to one of these sessions
- the trainee is expected to participate actively in the session they have signed up to
- active participation: say something, ask something, help writing notes, talk about previous or upcoming workshops
- after the session is completed, the host of the session will fill out a form and submit it to the Carpentries, indicating which of the participants was there for their checkout
- in the mentoring session, encourage trainees to:
  - [ ] sign up for an upcoming discussion session within 90 days from their instructor training
  - [ ] think about what they would like to know from the community or about the community; or about teaching workshops

## 2. Contribution to Carpentries material

- The Carpentries thrives because people contribute to the materials and documentation
- the goal with the contribution is to ensure that the trainee has worked through one lesson and shares the Carpentries' spirit of collaboration and contribution to Open Source software and Open Educational Resources
- trainees are often insecure about what is a "good enough" contribution:
  - suggesting the correction of a typo is good enough
  - commenting on, or answering to, an "Issue" in one of the Carpentries GitHub repositories is good enough
  - creating a new "Issue" with either a question or a comment in one of the Carpentries GitHub repositories is good enough
  - improving ANY (including the instructor training materials, the Carpentries documentation, the website content, etc.) of the Carpentries materials this way is good enough
- in the mentoring session, encourage trainees to:
  - [ ] work through a lesson of their choice thoroughly and find something to edit/improve/delete/add/comment on
  - [ ] ask for help if they are not comfortable with GitHub Issues and Pull Requests yet
- you can also share your own teaching experiences and where you would have improved the materials, or where you made adjustments for teaching

## 3. Teaching Demonstration

- many trainees find this checkout step to be a bit scary
- the goal with the teaching demo is to show that the trainee has understood the Carpentries teaching philosophy, especially participatory live coding
- teaching demos are hosted regularly, usually several times per month, by the Carpentries
- Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos
- the trainee is expected to sign up to one of these demo sessions
- the trainee is expected to have prepared an ENTIRE lesson of their choice for the teaching demo
- the trainee is expected to teach 5 minutes from this lesson during the teaching demo
- the host of the teaching demo (an instructor trainer) will chose the starting point from the lesson the trainee has selected and keep time
- the trainee is expected to give structured feedback to their fellow trainees in the form of the feedback rubric (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/)
- in the mentoring session, encourage trainees to:
  - [ ] sign up for a teaching demo via the Etherpad
  - [ ] select a lesson they are comfortable with for the demo
  - [ ] prepare the lesson by going through the material again as a learner (tutorial-style) and speak out loud what they are typing and what it says in the descriptive text
  - [ ] practice live coding, i.e. speaking what you type while you type it
  - [ ] set up everything they need from the lesson on their computers and dry-run teaching a lesson
- the instructor trainers that host the teaching demos want to make sure that trainees feel safe and can show their skills; it is not an examination and we do not pass judgement on trainees, but give structured, criteria-based, friendly peer-feedback on their teaching
- it is not just OK, but expected that trainees use the lesson materials while they are teaching; no need to memorize lesson materials or create new materials
- trainees can redo a teaching demo in case they did not pass

## Complications

- In case the 90 days are not sufficient to complete the three checkout tasks, trainees may ask for an extension
- they can send an email to checkout@carpentries.org
- during Covid-19, applications for extensions are generally accommodated, regardless of the reasons

## Community and Joy

- becoming an instructor is not all about teaching, knowing lesson materials by heart and being skilled with GitHub actions!
- becoming an instructor is also great fun, a chance to grow personally and professionally, to meet new people and join an active community of like-minded people all across the globe
- encourage trainees to come to social gatherings, to help and co-teach at workshops, have a coffee with them on campus, write an email asking how they are doing and say hi if they are in the same building as you are, when you meet them on the t-bane or in other contexts!
- and last but not least: mentoring is fun, too! Share your joy of teaching and being a part of this community! It's you who makes this a great place to be :)

## Community support for new instructors

- The board aims to offer monthly follow-up meetings for newly trained instructors during their checkout process. 
- The goal of these meetings is to support the instructors-in-training with their checkout task, provide a welcoming environment with the possibility to get to know other fresh instructors, and to integrate the new instructors into the community.
- Newly trained instructors can be added as community members to the [Carpentry@UiO webpage](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/carpentry-uio/)
