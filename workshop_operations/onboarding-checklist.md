-->

### **What do I have to do before, during, and after a workshop?**
#### Before:
- [ ] check the results of the pre-workshop survey to understand your learners
- [ ] if you can, try out the projector, check the network, etc. to ensure technical parts work as planned (if not, of if any equipment is needed, contact the local coordinator)
- [ ] check whether you have or need an adapter to connect your laptop to the monitor in the workshop room
#### During:
  - [ ] Explain the Code of Conduct in the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Do a short security briefing in the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Take attendance using the workshop attendance check list provided by local coordinator
  - [ ] Ask the participants to answer post-workshop survey linked from the workshop website at the end of the workshop
  - [ ] Leave the seminar room clean and orderly; make sure that no equipment is left, windows are closed and lights are off
#### After:
- [ ] Collect the sticky-note feedback after the workshop
- [ ] Right after the workshop, do a brief feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors writes up a short summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers
- Workshop participants can ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop:
- [ ] For non-standard workshops (e.g. when only a part of core lessons are covered), a certificate is generated automatically – ask your local coordinator about it
- [ ] For standard workshops (i.e., 2-day full program covering all [core lessons](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core)), learner certificates can be obtained by following the instructions in the [Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/certificates.html)

### **Who do I contact in case something happens?**
- [ ] In case of fire call **110**

## **Online format**
When a Carpentry workshop is done online, there are different things to consider than in-person format. Please check and study the followings.
- [ ] [Resources for Online Workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/resources_for_online_workshops.html)
- [ ] [Recommendations for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#instructional-team-roles-who-what-when)
- [ ] Depending on the topics to teach, consider planning a separate session for set-up/installation help in advance of the workshop

### **What platforms and functions should we use?**
- [ ] UiO staff has access to Zoom meeting. If you need, ask local coordinator to set up a Zoom meeting.
- [ ] Zoom functions are constantly updated. Discuss and agree with co-instructors and helpers on which functions to use and how.
- [ ] Involving local coordinator(s), plan well the style of the workshop;
  - [ ] how to use breakout rooms (depending on the characteristics of exercises, e.g. if teaming up is required, discussion is encouraged, or mostly done individually)
  - **Use of a breakout room for individual help while main session is ongoing is not very much recommended unless it is super necessary, as it causes leaving the learner behind. It is best to take time for installation and set-up help in advance of the workshop, plan sufficient time for both main session and exercise time, provide history of commands by other means than shared screen, etc.** 
  - **Helping the person in trouble in the main session is not recommended, either, unless the workshop size is very small and have enough time. This is because it causes delay and frustration or reduction of engagement by the other learners. It is best to help in the exercise session while others can work on exercises. Therefore it is best to prepare minimum and extra exercises** 
  - [ ] how helpers should be assigned during the exercises (coming on demand vs. assignment of a regular helper to one room, etc.)  
  - [ ] how to communicate with the learners (command history, questions about contents, technical questions, emergency)
- [ ] For backend communication, chat platform separate from the Zoom is handy. Consider by a team what is the best option to use.
- [ ] Carpentries offers now CodiMD as a collaborative online note in addition to Etherpad. Discuss by the team how to use the online notebook and who are following the online note.
- [ ] Consider what to screen-share during breaks (e.g. vclock.com to show until when the brek is)

### **What do I have to do before, during, and after a workshop?**
#### Before:
- [ ] Check the results of the pre-workshop survey to understand your learners
- [ ] Rehearse what to share by screen sharing, preferably with co-instructors and helpers to make sure
- [ ] Discuss and agree on how to do in emergency case (internet disconnection etc.)
- [ ] Prepare backup plan (if applicable and possible)
#### During:
  - [ ] Explain the Code of Conduct at the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Explain how to communicate and demonstrate how to and/or let them try use each function and/or platform
  - [ ] Ask the participants to answer post-workshop survey linked from the workshop website at the end of the workshop
 ### After:
- [ ] Collect the sticky-note feedback after the workshop
- [ ] Right after the workshop, do a brief feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors writes up a short summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers
- Workshop participants can ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop:
- [ ] For non-standard workshops (e.g. when only a part of core lessons are covered), a certificate is generated automatically – ask your local coordinator about it
- [ ] For standard workshops (i.e., 2-day full program covering all [core lessons](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core)), learner certificates can be obtained by following the instructions in the [Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/certificates.html)


### **What do I have to do before, during, and after a workshop?**

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [Carpentries Guidelines for running workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#instructor-checklist)

 Additionally, we ask you kindly to
- *Co-instructor*
  - [ ] Coordinate with your co-instructors and helpers
  - [ ] Coordinate with the local or regional coordinator
  - [ ] Make sure the equipment you are planning to use works in the seminar room

  - [ ] Leave the seminar room clean and orderly; make sure that no equipment is left, windows are closed and lights are off

- *Helpers*
  - [ ] Get in contact with the co-instructors, familiarize yourself with the teaching materials and exercises. It is usually in the very beginning and during exercises that helpers are needed most
  - [ ] (For 2 full-day standard workshop) Make sure that the coffee station looks tidy
  - [ ] Be attentive: look actively for sticky notes coming up – and if participants look lost during lessons
  - [ ] If you see that a lot of sticky notes come up or many participants get lost, gently interrupt the co-instructor, so that everyone can catch up
---

### **How is the workshop de-briefing done?**
- [ ] Collect the sticky-note feedback after the workshop
- [ ] Right after the workshop, do a brief feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors writes up a short summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] One week after the workshop, the local coordinator will send out a workshop evalulation form to all participants. A summary of all feedback is provided after each term in the form of a presentation or a written report by the coordinator. Ask the local coordinator for the feedback for your workshop at any time.

### **How do I get in contact with workshop participants?**
- [ ] If you want to get in contact with participants, please send an email to carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no so that the local coordinator will send the email on behalf of you from the registration system
- *Registration for workshops is handled by the local coordinator. By default, registration is closed two weeks prior to the workshop date. Automatic reminders for workshop participants are sent out via the registration system one week and again three days before the workshop. Any additional information that were sent to workshop participants from instructors can be set in the registration system so that is is automatically sent when one in the waiting list is offered a seat due to cancellation of someone else.*
