-->

### **What do I have to do before, during, and after a workshop?**
#### Before:
- [ ] check the results of the pre-workshop survey to understand your learners
- [ ] if you can, try out the projector, check the network, etc. to ensure technical parts work as planned (if not, or if any equipment is needed, contact the local coordinator)
- [ ] check whether you have or need an adapter to connect your laptop to the monitor in the workshop room
#### During:
  - [ ] Explain the Code of Conduct at the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Do a short security briefing at the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Take attendance using the workshop attendance checklist provided by the local coordinator
  - [ ] Ask the participants to answer the post-workshop survey linked from the workshop website at the end of the workshop
  - [ ] Leave the seminar room clean and orderly; make sure that no equipment is left, windows are closed, and lights are off
#### After:
- [ ] Collect the sticky-note feedback after the workshop
- [ ] Right after the workshop, do brief feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors writes up a summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers
- Workshop participants can ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop:
- [ ] For non-standard workshops (e.g. when you cover only a part of the core lessons), we create a certificate automatically – ask your local coordinator about it
- [ ] For standard workshops (i.e., a 2-day full program covering all [core lessons](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core)), learners can obtain a certificate by following the instructions in the [Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/certificates.html)

## **Online format**
When a Carpentry workshop is held online, there are different things to consider than the in-person format. Please check and study the following steps.
- [ ] [Resources for Online Workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/resources_for_online_workshops.html)
- [ ] [Recommendations for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#instructional-team-roles-who-what-when)
- [ ] Depending on the topics to teach, consider planning a separate session for set-up/installation help in advance of the workshop

### **What platforms and functions should we use?**
- [ ] UiO staff has access to Zoom meetings. If necessary, ask the local coordinator to set up a Zoom meeting.
- [ ] Zoom functions are constantly updated. Discuss and agree with co-instructors and helpers on which functions to use.
- [ ] Involving local coordinator(s), plan well the style of the workshop;
  - [ ] how to use breakout rooms (depending on the characteristics of exercises, e.g. if teaming up is required, discussing is encouraged, or mostly done individually)
  - **Use of a breakout room for individual help while the main session is ongoing is not recommended unless it is indispensable, as it causes leaving the learners behind. It is better to take time for installation and set-up help before the workshop starts, so plan sufficient time for both the main session and exercise time, provide a history of commands by other means than a shared screen, etc.**
  - **We don't recommend helping a person in trouble in the main session unless the workshop size is small and you have enough time. It causes delays and frustration and reduces the engagement of the other learners. It is better to help in the exercise session while others can work on the exercises. We recommend preparing both minimum and additional exercises**
  - [ ] how you assign helpers during the exercises (coming on-demand vs assignment of a regular helper to one room, etc.)  
  - [ ] how to communicate with the learners (command history, questions about contents, technical questions, emergency)
- [ ] A chat platform separate from Zoom is handy for backend communication. Consider by a team what is the best option to use.
- [ ] Carpentries now offers CodiMD as a collaborative online note in addition to Etherpad. Discuss in the team how to use the online notebook and who is following the online notes.
- [ ] Consider what to screen-share during breaks (e.g. vclock.com to show until when the break is)

### **What do I have to do before, during, and after a workshop?**
#### Before:
- [ ] Check the results of the pre-workshop survey to understand your learners
- [ ] Rehearse what to share by screen sharing, preferably with co-instructors and helpers, to make sure
- [ ] Discuss and agree on how to do it in an emergency case (internet disconnection etc.)
- [ ] Prepare a backup plan (if applicable and possible)
#### During:
  - [ ] Explain the Code of Conduct at the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Explain how to communicate and demonstrate how-to and let them try to use each function and platform
  - [ ] Ask the participants to answer the post-workshop survey linked from the workshop website at the end of the workshop
 ### After:
- [ ] Collect the sticky-note feedback after the workshop
- [ ] Right after the workshop, do brief feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors writes up a summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers
- Workshop participants can ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop:
- [ ] For non-standard workshops (e.g. when you only cover a part of core lessons), we generate a certificate automatically – ask your local coordinator about it
- [ ] For standard workshops (i.e., a 2-day full program covering all [core lessons](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core)), learners can obtain a certificate by following the instructions in the [Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/certificates.html)

### **What do I have to do before, during, and after a workshop?**

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [Carpentries Guidelines for running workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#instructor-checklist)

 Additionally, we ask you kindly to
- *Co-instructor*
  - [ ] Coordinate with your co-instructors and helpers
  - [ ] Coordinate with the local or regional coordinator
  - [ ] Make sure the equipment you are planning to use works in the seminar room
  - [ ] Explain the Code of Conduct at the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Do a short security briefing at the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Take attendance using the workshop attendance checklist provided by the local coordinator
  - [ ] Ask the participants to answer the post-workshop survey linked from the workshop website at the end of the workshop
  - [ ] Leave the seminar room clean and orderly; make sure that no equipment is left, windows are closed, and lights are off

- *Helpers*
  - [ ] Get in contact with the co-instructors, and familiarize yourself with the teaching materials and exercises. It is usually in the very beginning and during exercises that helpers are needed most
  - [ ] (For two full-day standard workshops) Make sure that the coffee station looks tidy
  - [ ] Be attentive: look actively for sticky notes coming up – and if participants look lost during lessons
  - [ ] If you see that a lot of sticky notes come up or many participants get lost, gently interrupt the co-instructor so that everyone can catch up
---

### **How is the workshop de-briefing done?**
- [ ] Collect the sticky-note feedback after the workshop
- [ ] Right after the workshop, do brief feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors writes up a summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] The local coordinator will send out a workshop evaluation form to all participants one week after the workshop. The coordinator summarises all feedback after each term in a presentation or a written report. Ask the local coordinator for feedback on your workshop at any time.
---
### **How do I get in contact with workshop participants?**
- [ ] If you want to get in contact with participants, please send an email to carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no so that the local coordinator will send the email on behalf of you from the registration system
- *The local coordinator handles registration for workshops. By default, we close registration two weeks before the workshop date. Automatic reminders for workshop participants are sent out via the registration system one week and again three days before the workshop. The registration system can handle any additional information that instructors want to send participants, i.e. notifications of free spots on the waiting list.*
- Workshop participants can ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop:
- [ ] For non-standard workshops (e.g. when you only cover a part of the core lessons), we generate certificates automatically – ask your local coordinator about it
- [ ] For standard workshops (i.e., a 2-day complete program covering all [core lessons](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core)), learners can obtain a certificate by following the instructions in the [Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/certificates.html)
