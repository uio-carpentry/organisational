### 2. Plan a workshop (to be complete in order from 1-7)

**1. Choose a lesson**
* You can teach any of the lessons from the Carpentries curriculum, including the core lessons from [Software](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), [Data](http://datacarpentry.org/lessons/), and/or [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/). Alternatively, if you have developed lesson material you can contact [carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no).  

**2. Answer the call/ reach out** 
* Several times per semester, we send out calls to [organizers@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:organizers@carpentry.uio.no) mailing list, reply to the call if you are interested. 
* You can also contact the local or the regional coordinator and propose a workshop by sending an email to [carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no).

**3. Find co-instructors and helpers**
* Ask the community via [organizers@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:organizers@carpentry.uio.no), or attend our bi-annual event where
* Tip: ask for new helpers via [announcements@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:announcements@carpentry.uio.no).

**4. Familiarize yourself with the General guidelines**
 * The [Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/index.html)
 * The [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
 * [Instructor Checklist](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#instructor-checklist)
 * [Tips For Instructors](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/instructor_tips.html)

**5. Plan out the following with the help of your co-instructor(s):**
* Decide which episodes and exercises (minimum and extra) to cover. 
* Decide who teaches which episodes and exercises. 
* Create a timeline for the day, be sure to allot time for set-up, introduction (inc. explanation of Code of Conduct), breaks, closing remarks and the post-workshop survey/ feedback. 
* Preferred date(s) 

**6. Share the above information with your helpers and [carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no)**

**7. Edit the workshop website on GitHub**
* Once you have shared the above information, [carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no), will then set up a **workshop repository** in the [UiO-Carpentry Git Hub page](https://github.com/uio-carpentry).
* You must **edit the necessary parts** by following the README.md "Customizing Your Website", and the website will be created automatically.
* When the contents are in place, send a notification to [carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no)


* * * 
### 3. Teach a workshop

**1. Before**
* Check the results of pre-workshop survey to understand your learners.
* If you can, try out the projector, check the network, etc. to ensure technical parts work as planned (if not, or if any equipment is needed, contact carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no) 
* Get the Carpentries equipment box, which is located in the University of Oslo’s HumSam library 2nd floor offices (contact [carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no)) 

**2. During**
* Explain the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) at the beginning of the workshop.
* Do a short **security briefing** at the beginning of the workshop.
* Ask the participants to answer the **post-workshop survey** at the end of the workshop, as well as feedback using the sticky notes provided in the equipment box (collect these).
* Leave the seminar room clean and orderly; make sure that no equipment is left, windows are closed, and lights are off. 
* Promote other [Carpentry@UiO workshops](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/courses/other/Carpentry/) as well as [UiO’s Digital Scholarship Centre (DSC)](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/) 

**3. After**
* Right after the workshop, do a feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers, using the sticky note feedback as guidance. 
* A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors must **write a summary of the feedback and general impressions** from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers. 
* Workshop participants can ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop:
	* For non-standard workshops (e.g. when you cover only a part of the core lessons), we create a certificate automatically, ask [carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no](mailto:carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no). 
	* For standard workshops (i.e., a 2-day full program covering all core lessons), learners can obtain a certificate by following the instructions in the Carpentries Handbook. 
 
#**In case of emergency:**
* In case of fire call 110
* In case of medical emergency call 113 
* In an emergency, call 112 or UiO security 228 56666
* If someone gets locked into or out of a building, call UiO facility management 228 55007
* Lost and Found: Contact carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no or the local building administrator for UiO buildings.
