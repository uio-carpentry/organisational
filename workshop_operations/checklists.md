* It is mandatory to use the `Bcc` field for sending emails to participants - that way we protect participants' privacy by not displaying email addresses to all recipients.
* email lists:
  * ``carpadmin @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` --> coordinators at the University Library (and the initiators of Carpentry@UiO)
  * ``organizers @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` --> all instructors and helpers, plus those on the admin list
  * ``announcements @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` --> all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organisers list

# Lead instructor

## Initial Preparation

* the coordinators will send out calls for workshops regularly during the academic year
* you can always also propose to teach a workshop by sending an email to ``carpadmin @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no``
* To generate the workshop website at uio-carpentry dot github dot com:
  1) make sure you are a member of uio-carpentry, the [uio-carpentry github organisation](https://github.com/orgs/uio-carpentry/people). If you aren't, send an email to carpadmin @ swcarpentry.uio.no with your GitHub username to invite you.
  2) create the webpage using the template from https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template. NOTE: as the repository name, *use YYYY-MM-DD-uio* (using the correct date) and not python/R/oslo... or any other text, and *choose the organisation uio-carpentry as owner* for the workshop repository when you import the template. (If needed, ownership can be transferred later)
* Submit a self-organized workshop to Carpentry central from [this form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/).     Note: If you're running a one-day workshop, choose *Short session (less than two days)*, and UiO workshops are usually public, so please choose *This event is open to the public*. You may add your co-instructors'/helpers' email addresses in the last field where you are asked about communication.
  The Regional Coordinator will then register instructor information at the Carpentry's sytem as well as make workshop information visible on Carpentry website. 
* organise pre-workshop meeting with the other instructors and the helpers to go through lesson materials etc.

## A Week Before

* obtain and send pre-workshop questionnaire to attendants

## The Day Before

* if you can, set up the room (tables, chairs), try out the projector, check the network, etc.
* check whether you have or need an adapter to connect your laptop to the monitor in the workshop room

## At/during the workshop

* do a head count and note the number of participants down (report this number to ``carpadmin @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no``)
* collect feedback from sticky notes
* if there is time at the end of the workshop send the post-workshop questionnaire to attendants to increase response rate
* collect workshop equipment after the workshop
* set the room
* leave the crate with coffee thermos and other dishes outside the room

## After the workshop

* send post-workshop questionnaire to attendants (even though you may have sent it already at the workshop, to reach those that had to leave early)
* for official The Carpentries workshops, send an email to the Carpentries admin at ``team @ carpentries dot org`` the number of attendants for both days
* obtain the post-workshop assessment form link from the workshop's uio-carpentry.github.io pages, or from SWC/DC admin
* download the workshop etherpad in text format; take out any information that should not be sent around and send it to the participants
* organise a post-workshop debriefing with the other instructors and the helper
* optionally, deliver sticky note feedback to the Carpentries@UiO-coordinator's office for archiving

# Helpers

## At/during the workshop

* if coffee, tea, or water runs out contact Carpentries@UiO-coordinator or the library contact and see if more can be arranged
* help collecting workshop equipment after the workshop
* help setting the room
* be attentive: you likely notice participants' challenges and problems much better than the instructors
* be kind to yourselves: no one expects you to know solutions to all the problems

# University Library

## Initial Preparation

* book rooms for the semester
* send out calls for co-instructors and helpers
* set up a registration form (Pindena)
* ask lead instructor for the URL of the workshop information page (usually uio-carpentry.github.uio/YYYY-DD-MM-uio)
* set up an event on uio.no course catalogue
* advertise event by sending an email to ``announcements @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` and other relevant lists and via the official social media channels of the University Library

## Two Weeks Before

## At/during the workshop

* prepare signs directing learners to the workshop room, these can be found in this repositorys
* take the second monitor + laptop to the workshop room (if needed)
* bring box with other essentials to the workshop room (if not NHA room 209)
   * the box is in the small cupboard in room 209 in NHA (Science library) and contains:
     * extension cables
     * sticky notes
     * non-permanent markers and/or chalk
     * pens
   
## After the workshop

* collect the second monitor + laptop
