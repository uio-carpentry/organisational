# General

* these checklists are in addition to the ones [provided by SWC and DC](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations/) for their official workshops - note that not all workshops at UiO are official SWC/DC workshops
* It is preferred to use the `Bcc` field for sending email to participants - that we way we protect their privacy by not displaying their email address to all recipients.

  * admin @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no --> University Library and some instructors
  * organizers @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no --> all instructors and helpers, plus those on the admin list
  * announce @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no --> all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organisers list

* send post-workshop questionnaire to attendants (even though you may have sent it already at the workshop, to reach those that had to leave early)
* for official SWC/DC workshops, send Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry admin the number of attendants for both days
