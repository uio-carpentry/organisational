12:00-13:00 

Attending: FB, DT, NF, MA, LEM; DSC/Library: EP, MG, MLB

Not attending: RS

## Introduction and distribution of roles
All board members introduce themselves to each other in an introduction round. Board roles as stated in the [charter](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/about/charter/) are discussed and distributed in mutual agreement. Notes: Chair should be someone from the previous board but is not expected to have a higher workload than other board members, community events officer does not need to organise events alone but will be supported by the library staff. 

Chair: DT
Vice-chair: FB
Secretary: LEM
Communications officer: MA
Community events officer: NF
Elections officer: RS (assigned in absence)

DT gives a summary of how the board works. We can adjust this to the new board's needs. Expected meeting frequency is ca. three per semester.
Tasks:
- EP follows up before/after transition meeting tasks as described in the [onboarding/offboarding checklist](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/board/on-offboarding_board.md#checklist-for-onboarding-incoming-and-offboarding-outgoing-board-members) (adding/removing members to the different resources of the board).
- EP/MLB update the [list of board members](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/about/members/) on our webpage
- ALL board members to familiarise themselves with the board's resources on GitHub and in the Google Drive

## Instructors in training
EP and one more (Dr F Aurora from the University Library) finishing up their training, currently no immediate need to establish follow-up sessions for the new Communications officer. There are 3 open spots for this year, send suggestions to library staff who keep track. (Note: applicants need to agree to teach at least two workshops to be eligible to get a spot). FB suggested Dr J Cheneby from the Centre of Bioinformatics as a possible candidate based on past excellent contributions. It is to be noted, however, that JC is likely to leave the country. EP to get in touch with JC. Another person indicated to FB he wishes to become an instructor and was invited by FB to get directly involved in teaching.

## Carpentries membership 
New membership year starting in June. MG recommends continuing with the current membership level (5 tokens for instructor training per year).

## Request from MedFac
DT got an email request in mid-March from the "forskerutdanningsleder" of the Medical Faculty for more/specific R/Python courses at their faculty. There is a need for mostly beginner courses (but advanced courses would also be OK) among PhD students/staff at their faculty. Could we help to establish something for them, maybe togeter with USIT/the library? 
- MA follows up, DT forwards the details

## Next meeting
After a slow start, we aim for two more meetings this semester. Next meeting: 7.5., 11-12.
- EP sends out a meeting invite
- ALL send upcoming discussion/agenda points to the board chair or add them to the [discussion points living document](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/agenda_points_living_document.md)
