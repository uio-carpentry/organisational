## Brief Intro to HackMD

- Use for workshops that are not official Carpentries courses, where we can't use the Carpentries resources

## Workshops that have been going on 

- Tidyverse 25th - 27th workshop
    - Adminstrative meeting yesterday:
    - who to accept, how to publish? 


### Why so few workshops?

- COVID situation, unstable, unforseeable
- workshop had to be postponed, littel interest from instructors


## Carpentries membership tier level

- some people use (parts of) carpentries instructor training for 1 day "how to become a better teacher workshop"
- can we do something like that - make our own module?
- one approach: be generous with instructor training spots, hope that some of them "stick around" to become carpentries instructors
- keep the silver membership (current level) for now, and go for a higher tier next year when the situation is more stable?


## To be discussed with the library

- better access to rooms (before they are taken by courses)
- how do we help instructors get something back (count Carpentries instruction as part of compulsory teaching duty)


## use announcement email list for other (non-carpentry events)

- ~800 people on list, many outsiders
- quality of teaching not always up tjo Carpentry standards
- GDPR consent not given for people on the list -- **solve!**
    - opt-out not an option
    - must be active opt-in ("Click this link to resubscribe")
    - send a link to re-signup 
    - @Aino will figure it out 


## Lisense of the logo?

- We do not have a trademark
- for non-carpentry workshop we need to remove all Carpentry related things.
- Logo lives in the [organisational repo](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/tree/master/uio-carpentry-logofiler)
- it has a CC-By 4.0 license
- Someone has modified and used it in Sweden
- Should we allow "outsiders" to use, modify it? 
- logo license in [website repo](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/uio-carpentry.github.io/blob/master/README.md) was not correct (implicitly CC-0; Fixed now)


## Elections

- we missed one election in fall 2020
- next election (fall?), two seats should be up for election
- activity is low to the moment. Things might be better in a year from now...
- not much connection with community at the moment.
- Should we hold the elections for another year? 
- Is it undemocratic *not* to have elections?

*Decision:* see whether we can have an election somehow, have an election in August, call for candidates around June


## Community engagement

- Doing another social activity
- setting up an election to create some momentum?
- blog post for the Carpentries 
- newsletter?
    - what have we done
    - announce elections
    - "testimonials" from learners 


*Does UiO have means to make nice-looking newsletters?*
