## Board meeting of 24.8.2023

13:00-14:00 in DSC Oasen

Attending: board (4), carpadmin/DSC (4)

Minutes: DT

Topic: Amend the charter and fix the election process



### **Agenda points and notes**
---
1. Election this fall, but some changes in charter necessary. Currently
    four elected board members, two assigned (library).
   
   a. Charter: Elections every fall, 2 years election period.
      
    - 1 year is too short to do something, 4 years is too long for temporary contracts, 2 (as now) works well with 4 members. 3 is out of sync with election schedule (annually/bi-annually) unless we increase to 6 board member but might be a good middle ground.
    - There should be a limit on how many times one can be re-elected especially if the election period is increased. Two on - one off is common.
    - Organising the election is time-consuming, this has been a hindrance in the past. Problems: workload, too many people involved. 
    - Annual meeting with local votes may be easier, best in combination with end-of-year party. Can still be with a self-nominating process beforehand, and possibilities for people voting for someone else (fullmakt).

    b. Charter: Number of board members: currently 4, should there be more?
    - There seems to be too much to do, so we may need more people
    - New people should have specific roles: communications officer should be more concrete, carpentry con/events officer
    - Roles need to fit to tasks that are currently not done timely/falling out. Important need that needs to be filled:  community/social manager, keeping the community going

    c. Charter: Prepare executive council meetings
    - we don't have an executive council. Remove that.

    d. Next steps
    - LN will prepare changes to the charter and send to the board ahead of the next board meeting. The changes will be voted on during the next board meeting.

2. Move the September meeting due to a scheduling conflict
