## Pick-up email discussion: "Have we failed our community?"

The discussion of how to jumpstart the Carpentry community building and of how to maintain the interest and involvement of volunteers is very high on the agenda. One question that needs to be raised and discussed is whether volunteers can use their regular working hours to work on Carpentry instruction and preparation.

## Election status and updates

- Carpentry@UiO Board Election: The board discussed different potential candidates and drew up a list.
- [x] Action points: A strategy and timeline for the election process has been disseminated and the process of nomination of candidates is underway.

## Other issues

- In order to ensure instructors remain active in the Carpentry community, we should draw up an agreement with them at the end of their instructor training. Also, instructors at DSC could potentially be introduced to the Carpentry instructor training course.

  - [x] AR has offered another spot to an interested potential instructor but received no reply
