:::info
- **Location:** Zoom
- **Date:** March 14, 2022 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM
- **Agenda**
- **Participants:**
    - Lex (Carpentry@UiO)
    - Désirée (Carpentry@UiO)
    - Mohamed (Carpentry@UiO)
    - Annika (Carpentry@UiO, Library)
    - Aino (Carpentry@UiO, Library)
    - Matthew (Carpentry@UiO/Digital Scholarship Center)
    - Anne (Carpentry@UiO/TASK)
    - Jarle (TASK)

1. **Introduction**
    Participants are from different organisations within UiO, all of which offer courses.
	
2. **What courses / organisations are there to coordinate?**
    - USIT courses: historically mainly targeting social/medical sciences, entry level: https://www.usit.uio.no/english/about/organisation/rc/dcm/task/
    - Carpentries formally all disciplines. Goal: core courses at least once each semester (python, git, R, shell): https://uio-carpentry.github.io/
    - University Library organises courses for various tools, will be lined up for 2023
    - HPC course week
    - CodeRefinery missing in the round: more advanced coding stuff beyond carpentries/TASK level, online-only, always targeted towards Nordic audience, not UiO specifically. 


3.  **Synergies, plans and challenges**

    - Carpentries fill a gap that shouldn’t be there with their more basic, general courses. There is also data carpentries which focuses on field-specific data analysis. 
    - TASK tries to alternate course languages between English/Norwegian (either-or each semester). Some ad-hoc courses, some courses focused on different content/data. People are after methods courses with rather specialised problems rather than general programming courses where you learn for loops. 
    - easiest for short-term planning: TASK publishes their courses asap, and Carpentries schedules accordingly. TASK have their plans ready in June-August. 
    - Carpentries has a focus on pedagogy with instructor training courses (training spots paid by Carpentries membership of the library), this training could be useful for others, too.

    Challenges:
    - Room booking – all parties lack a group teaching room available that can be booked far in advance. Establish a dedicated room via the DSC?
    - Carpentries: all is voluntary work, no-one paid and thus a lot of flexibility needed. Difficult to plan long-term. Only library courses are taught by library staff as part of their work.
    - Carpentries are short of people teaching shell/git/UNIX. 
    - Carpentries/code refinery are depending on funding:
        - code refinery is sustained for only a few years. The library would be interested in closer links. 
        - Carpentry@UiO is supported by the library, but the membership may be changing in the future (i.e. fewer instructor training spots)


4. **Action points:**
    - medium/long-term coordination: plan the fall (May/June) -> *Anne*
    - Can we collect all courses on one webpage? -> *Matthew* 
    - Group teaching room for live-coding courses, via DSC? -> *Matthew* 
    - Pick up ties to Sabry and Anne, which are currently focusing on code refinery.
