### 1. Code Refinery Workshop

FB Proposed to create ties with the CodeRefinery group and volunteered to help with workshops. 

The workshops include the following topics: 
* how to work with code in research;
* version control;
* writing good code for maintaining data.
  
It is 6 half days in September from 9:00 to 13:00 each day ([link](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/)).

MG mentioned Carpentries at UiO has previously had ties with Code Refinery.

DT Suggested we need 1-2 people to assist. Particularly to help coordinate for logistics (e.g., room, water).

EP Emphasised booking rooms due to high demand.

DT Suggested to temporarily block rooms on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the semester. Then to make rooms available 3 weeks before for others.

EP Volunteered to coordinate the call for instructors and the general organisation of the event (see https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/issues/113)

### 2. Python Workshop Modifications

FB Discussed the need to modify the Python workshop due to potential upcoming changes in the course from Carpentries. We need to ensure participants can install necessary programs despite the lack of admin access.

### 3. Yearly plan

DT Progress on the yearly plan ("List.md") needs updating by each board member for completed tasks. Also, suggested reviewing previous board meetings to ensure task completion.

EP Mentioned that LEM, FB, and NF need to provide their Google account details for drive access.

FB Suggested using GitHub issues to assign tasks and volunteered to organize the list.

### 4. New Board Meeting Date
