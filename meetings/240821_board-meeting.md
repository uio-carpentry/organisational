# Board Meeting of 11.10.2024

**Chair**: DT  
**Minutes**: MLB  

## Attendees: FB, RS, DSC/library: EP, MLB

### 1. Update on Code Refinery Workshop and Carpentry courses 
There was the coderefinery September 10 - 12 and 17-19 -tried organised on a very short notice by EP and FB. The event was announced on UiOs web pages and registered to main organizer, but very few subscribed. On a better note; we now have a new contact from Coderefinery UiO,so that we can plan better next time! Sabry from USIT is the contact. We have to collaborate next time. Sabrye was eager, next time he can be asked to help if we organize but much earlier!
3 subscribed, then 2 after the form closed. Senior engineers, and they worked together. 

Conda and Docker
Some parts were better than others, but overall good. Some slides not good, some too small figures etc. not so popular.
12 subscribe, 9-10 in attendence, which is decent.

### 2. Instructor training spots
 - The "Follow-up instructor training (how many spots etc)" listed for August on the [years plan](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/board/yearlyplan/List.md) was not addressed at the board meeting. This should be highly prioritised at the next meeting.
    - Carpentries silver Membership, which runs from 01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025 - have used 0 of 5 instructor training seats
    - We should probably also have a better overview of who is currently getting trained. -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZWKY2Q2gTa3kRfcuniMMdaFyp6VrOz913eqCXDUCq8/edit?gid=1795017706#gid=1795017706
    - 
we finally got the document from carpentry that says how many spots; we have 5 spots until 30th june 2025.
put the date in the year wheel.
All shold have access to drive; carpentry drive. problems adding luis? UiO email, username.
everybody else have access.
document on instructor-status.
UiO token, fast track in the carpentry instructor courses.
start to find new people that can be relevant for instructor-spots, to give the tokens. 
Arturo for instance? yes. 
Anne Sæbø? Elisa asks.
Federico Aurora? Dont think so.
stricter before to take the carpentry, a little easier now.
everybody thinks of names now - give away spots. Arturo is super, can be contacted rigth now if he is interested.   

### 3.Updates on the Yearwheel 
Put in: end of june instructors carpentry. Some changes made by DT. Most have filled out dates, but feel free to add more and look it over. 

### 4.Find more instructors/*How to get more advanced-level carpentry courses?*
    - Call for new instructors: flyer made by DSC staff
    - Discussion with SA from MatNat, August 2024: how to advertise our community and events at the MN faculty. SA sends out a newsletter every second week and would be happy to spread news from us
    - The MN newsletter could be a good place to send out a call for (new) instructors for advanced courses better catering MN people. Suggestion: write a little text and make a dedicated page with more info, or at least add 1-2 lines on our carpentry@uio landing page that we’re interested in advanced-topic courses. Sending out in ~November and maybe again early January would be great for course planning next semester.
         - Draft by EP: "*Join the Carpentry Community at UiO!*
           Carpentry@UiO is part of The Carpentries, a global, inclusive community teaching essential coding and data science skills through Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry. We are actively looking for instructors to teach across these areas or help develop new lessons. Helpers are also needed to assist instructors during workshops. Active instructors also have the opportunity to follow a course to become certified Carpentry instructors. If you're interested in becoming an instructor, helper, or simply joining our community, click here or contact us for more information. 
    - Notes added here earlier:
        - Advanced-level courses: Could these be follow-ups of the basic courses?
        - Somebody (was it Lex on Slack? I am not sure, I cannot find the original message) pointed out to the machine learning courses offered by USIT (e.g. [this](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/kurs/alle/dht/ml-python/events/2024-05-ml-python-intro.html)) and indicated that not having carpentry workshops on such topics would considerably hinder our visibility and relevance. Any thoughts?

libarayr matnat faculty all that is left of members.
Susan: PhD/researcher career adviser at the faculty. project, targeted especially for researchers. notices that they reported much stress.

Desiree and Mohammed are finished. we need everybody to find new people run for the board. 
the hybrid meetings are falling apart - feels better and more efficient to meet everybody.
its difficult to have a list, the rules are a bit strict, we changed the tone and the rules. just find a candidate.
more flexible, better to have one good candidate, but what if they do not at all know the carpentry community?
independent form UiO. can be anyone actually. outside - problem, never physical present...
Andrea very good candidate! we ask. 
Ada would also be great. 
timeline: forgotton to have them for two years. we have now thought of two already, can send to organizers community,

in person or online? in person, yes. 
last year so few. four position. federico and ragnhild elected. 
rwe want people to know the community and what it is all about. not forcing in general. 
less people but with motivation is always better. 
we have to rebuild the community. 
just have to work on it. 
people have so much to do, voluntary work is harder to recruit. 
new board: must make it pleasant at meetings! just needs to be organized. more social, just the board. 
the board shold be a power core - that makes postive impact to rest of community. 
try to make a lunch or a dinner with the board in november.
