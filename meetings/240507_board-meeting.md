# Board meeting of 07.05.2024

**Chair**: DT  
**Minutes**: LEM  
**Attendees**: FB, NF, RS, MA, DSC/library: EP, MLB

## Approval of Previous Minutes
The minutes from the previous meeting have been unanimously approved. In the future, the minutes will be uploaded to GitHub and an email notification will be sent. Board members have two weeks to edit and approve the minutes.

## Yearly plan (wheel)
A task group, consisting of RS and MLB, is formed to create an editable list for the yearly plan that can track all the courses and goals of Carpentry@UiO.

## Follow-up for Instructors in Training
MA is assigned to follow up with the two instructors in training. EP is to facilitate the interaction by email. 
At least one of the trainees is expected to complete the certification process by the end of June. 
There are two additional spots for instructor training, but this needs to be confirmed. EP, RS, and FB have potential candidates. A list of potential candidates is on the google drive. EP can edit, but not everyone has access to the google drive. MLB should also get ownership of the Google Drive. A meeting with all potential candidates is suggested to foster more engagement. EP will reach out to MG regarding the timeframe for filling out these two spots and to understand when the new batch of 5 tokens will become available. Some of the candidates might end up using tokens from this new batch depending on their involvement with the community. A virtual meeting with all potential candidates is suggested to foster more engagement. EP will schedule such an event and send invites.

## Version Control with GitHub 
The current course is outdated and needs to be updated (not by UiO members). FB or DT could potentially teach the  GitHub course in the autumn semester with support from other co-instructors. One of the candidates for the instructor training showed interest in being a co-instructor.

## Planning for Autumn Semester Courses 
Planning for the autumn semester courses will take place on August 21st.

## End of Spring Semester Social Event
A social event is planned to foster the sense of community among Carpentry@UiO members. The event could potentially be held outdoors or in a booked room at the campus. The event is planned for the first week of June. NF and EP will organize this event.

## Carpentry Conference (CarpentryCon)  
The idea of organizing a Carpentry conference was discussed but ultimately tabled for now due not having enough instructors to fully meet the demand.

## Communication of the Board  
The potential use of Slack or a mailing list for board communication was discussed.

## MA's Update on the Medical Faculty's Request
The medical faculty has expressed interest in more R programming courses. The Carpentry could potentially assist with this. However, it appears they have requests beyond what our services can provide at the moment.
   
## **Next Meeting**  
The next meeting is scheduled for the 21st of August. The meeting will start at 11 for the board meeting and continue at 12 for the planning meeting for the semester.
