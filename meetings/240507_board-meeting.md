## Approval of Previous Minutes
The minutes from the previous meeting have been unanimously approved. For the future, the approved minutes will be uploaded to GitHub and an email notification will be sent two weeks thereafter.

## **Yearly plan (wheel)**  
   A task group, consisting of RS and MLB, is formed to create an editable list for the yearly plan that can track all the courses and goals of the Carpentry.

## **Follow-up for Instructors in Training**  
   MA is assigned to follow up with the instructors in training. Two instructors could potentially be followed-up on. A meeting with all potential candidates is suggested to foster more engagement.
   There are potentially two additional spots for instructor training, but this needs to be confirmed. EP can RS and FB have potential candidates for instructor training. A list of potential candidates is on the google drive. EP can edit, but not everyone has access to the google drive. MLB should also get ownership of the google drive.

## **Version Control with GitHub**  
   The current course is outdated and needs to be updated. FB or DT could potentially teach the updated GitHub course in the autumn semester with support from other co-instructors.

## **Planning for Autumn Semester Courses**  
   Planning for the autumn semester courses will take place on August 21st.

## **End of Spring Semester Social Event**  
   A social event is planned to foster a sense of community among the Carpentry. The event could potentially be held outdoors or in a booked room at the campus. The event is planned for the first week of June. NF and EP will organize this event.

## **Carpentry Conference**  
   The idea of organizing a Carpentry conference was discussed but ultimately tabled for now due not having enough instructors to fully meet the demand.

## **Communication of the Board**  
   The potential use of Slack or a mailing list for board communication was discussed.

## **MA's Update on the Medical faculty request**  
   The medical faculty has expressed interest in more R programming courses. The Carpentry could potentially assist with this. However, it appears they have requests beyond what our services can provide at the moment.
   
## **Next Meeting**  
   The next meeting is scheduled for the 21st of August. The meeting will start at 11 for the board meeting and continue at 12 for the planning meeting for the semester.
