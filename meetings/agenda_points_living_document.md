# Agenda points to be addressed in future meetings
Intention: a place to add notes we should not forget to discuss in upcoming meetings. Dynamic document -- where information will be collected for actual agendas for meetings of the board.
All board members (maybe anyone, actually?) can add points to the agenda below. 

## Suggested agenda for November 2024 board meeting 

- ### Update on Carpentry courses and CodeRefinery (5')

- ### Status elections (15')
    - candidates?
    - practical: deadlines, format etc
    - point raised via email: are 2-3 years too long as an elected period? 
      Election rules and board composition last changed a year ago ([230824](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/230824_board_meeting.md) and [230918 minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/230918_board-meeting.md)), changes need an official request with new charter text and majority vote on a board meeting
    - Timeline in October meeting minutes [here](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/241011_board-meeting.md)

- ### Plan Christmas gathering (10')
    - See notes in previous meeting minutes [here](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/241011_board-meeting.md)

- ### Status on find-more-instructors advertising stunt / How to get more advanced-level carpentry courses? (15')
    - status ad on MN newsletter
    - GitHub and Vortex UiO pages updated?

- ### if we have spare time (10')
  - Add data collection consent to course sign-ups
    - discussed already in 2022: we would like to know who is attending our courses, see [221213 board meeting minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/221213_board_meeting.md)

- ### Varia (5')
* We agreed last time on a candidate for the instructor training. Shall we follow up on that to try to expedite the process?

## Longer-term discussion points:
- fill instructor spots before they "time out" (June) [-> candidates (accessible for board only)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZWKY2Q2gTa3kRfcuniMMdaFyp6VrOz913eqCXDUCq8/edit?gid=1795017706#gid=1795017706)
- finding more instructors, notes added here earlier:
        1.) Advanced-level courses: Could these be follow-ups of the basic courses?
        2.) Somebody (on Slack? unsure) pointed out to the machine learning courses offered by USIT (e.g. [this](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/kurs/alle/dht/ml-python/events/2024-05-ml-python-intro.html)) and indicated that not having carpentry workshops on such topics would considerably hinder our visibility and relevance.
