# Agenda points to be addressed in future meetings
Intention: a place to add notes we should not forget to discuss in upcoming meetings. Dynamic document -- where information will be collected for actual agendas for meetings of the board.
All board members (maybe anyone, actually?) can add points to the agenda below. 

- Check årshjul (should now be filled with tasks from everyone)
- *How to get more advanced-level carpentry courses?*
    - Could these be follow-ups of the basic courses?
    - Somebody (was it Lex on Slack? I am not sure, I cannot find the original message) pointed out to the machine learning courses offered by USIT (e.g. [this](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/kurs/alle/dht/ml-python/events/2024-05-ml-python-intro.html)) and indicated that not having carpentry workshops on such topics would considerably hinder our visibility and relevance. Any thoughts?
    - Discussion with SA from MatNat, August 2024: how to advertise our community and events at the MN faculty. SA sends out a newsletter every second week and would be happy to spread news from us
    - The MN newsletter could be a good place to send out a call for (new) instructors for advanced courses better catering MN people. Suggestion: write a little text and make a dedicated page with more info, or at least add 1-2 lines on our carpentry@uio landing page that we’re interested in advanced-topic courses. Sending out in ~November and maybe again early January would be great for course planning next semester.


Longer-term discussion points:
- Discuss/fill instructor spots before they "time out" (When is the next deadline? June?)
- CarpetryCon: reconsider again in 2025
