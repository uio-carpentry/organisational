# Agenda points to be addressed in future meetings
Intention: a place to add notes we should not forget to discuss in upcoming meetings. Dynamic document -- where information will be collected for actual agendas for meetings of the board.
All board members (maybe anyone, actually?) can add points to the agenda below. 

- ### Update on Carpentry courses and CodeRefinery (5')
  
- ### Instructor training spots (10')
    - The "Follow-up instructor training (how many spots etc)" listed for August on the [years plan](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/board/yearlyplan/List.md) was not addressed at the board meeting. This should be highly prioritised at the next meeting.
    - We should probably also have a better overview of who is currently getting trained.
      
- ### Check årshjul (should now be filled with tasks from everyone, 10')
  
- ### Find more instructors / *How to get more advanced-level carpentry courses?* (15')
    - Call for new instructors: flyer made by DSC staff
    - Discussion with SA from MatNat, August 2024: how to advertise our community and events at the MN faculty. SA sends out a newsletter every second week and would be happy to spread news from us
    - The MN newsletter could be a good place to send out a call for (new) instructors for advanced courses better catering MN people. Suggestion: write a little text and make a dedicated page with more info, or at least add 1-2 lines on our carpentry@uio landing page that we’re interested in advanced-topic courses. Sending out in ~November and maybe again early January would be great for course planning next semester.
         - Draft by EP: "*Join the Carpentry Community at UiO!*
           Carpentry@UiO is part of The Carpentries, a global, inclusive community teaching essential coding and data science skills through Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry. We are actively looking for instructors to teach across these areas or help develop new lessons. Helpers are also needed to assist instructors during workshops. Active instructors also have the opportunity to follow a course to become certified Carpentry instructors. If you're interested in becoming an instructor, helper, or simply joining our community, click here or contact us for more information. 
    - Notes added here earlier:
        - Advanced-level courses: Could these be follow-ups of the basic courses?
        - Somebody (was it Lex on Slack? I am not sure, I cannot find the original message) pointed out to the machine learning courses offered by USIT (e.g. [this](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/kurs/alle/dht/ml-python/events/2024-05-ml-python-intro.html)) and indicated that not having carpentry workshops on such topics would considerably hinder our visibility and relevance. Any thoughts?


- ### Elections (15')
    - EP: "the rules for eligibility and vote at the election look a bit too strict to me, would like to discuss this"
    - election rules and board composition last changed a year ago [230824](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/230824_board_meeting.md) and [230918 minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/230918_board-meeting.md)
    - board positions of MA and DT up for election
    - Plan Christmas party (dates) & election (responsibilities: Election and Community events officers)
    - Timeline last year (minutes [here](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/231121_board-meeting.md):
        - September/October: all board members consider candidates for the board
        - Week 45/46: DSC sends a draft mail to the community announcing the election and recruiting candidates
        - Mid-November, three weeks before the election, this email will be sent
        - Board meeting late November
        - Christmas party with election for 2025 board first week of December

Longer-term discussion points:
- Add data collection consent to course sign-ups
    - discussed already in 2022: we would like to know who is attending our courses, see [221213 board meeting minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/221213_board_meeting.md)
- Discuss/fill instructor spots before they "time out" (When is the next deadline? June?)
- CarpetryCon: reconsider again in 2025
- Status course credits/teaching certificate (see [221213 board meeting minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/221213_board_meeting.md), [230623 board meeting minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/230623_board_meeting.md)
