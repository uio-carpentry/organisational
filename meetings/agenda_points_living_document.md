# Agenda points to be addressed in future meetings
Intention: a place to add notes we should not forget to discuss in upcoming meetings. Dynamic document -- where information will be collected for actual agendas for meetings of the board.
All board members (maybe anyone, actually?) can add points to the agenda below. 

- Fill Ã¥rshjul with tasks
- Establish follow-up sessions for instructors in training. Who is currently in training? New candidates for instructor seats?
- organise end of semester social event
- Decide on carpetryCon: yes/no? If yes, when?

- How to get more advanced-level carpentry courses? Could these be follow-ups of the basic courses?
