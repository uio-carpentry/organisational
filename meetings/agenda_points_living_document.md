# Agenda points to be addressed in future meetings
Intention: a place to add notes we should not forget to discuss in upcoming meetings. Dynamic document -- where information will be collected for actual agendas for meetings of the board.
All board members (maybe anyone, actually?) can add points to the agenda below. 

- Discuss/fill instructor spots before they "time out" (June?)
- Review Ã¥rshjul (should now be filled with tasks)
- CarpetryCon: reconsider again in 2025
- How to get more advanced-level carpentry courses? Could these be follow-ups of the basic courses?
  - Somebody (was it Lex on Slack? I am not sure, I cannot find the original message) pointed out to the machine learning courses offered by USIT (e.g. [this](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/kurs/alle/dht/ml-python/events/2024-05-ml-python-intro.html)) and indicated that not having carpentry workshops on such topics would considerably hinder our visibility and relevance. Any thoughts?
