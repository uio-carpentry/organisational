# Board Meeting Minutes, 17-10-2025

**Chair**: FB

**Minutes**: FB

**Attendees**: FB, EP, RS, LEM, MG

**Excused**: 

**Absent**: NF

   * EP to contact NF about continuous absence 
   *  [Repository for Python WS](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/2025-10-29/) initisalised as a copy of the previous iteration
     * Potentially confusing, as people not involved are listed on the page, and people involved are not
     * Outdated installation setup, as the lesson moved away from Anaconda due to unclear policy for research and excessive pushing of commercial solutions
     * Q: Would it be possible to get rid of the repo and start from scratch? It would be cleaner and safer than starting to commit to the outdated template.
     * Answer: It was done to avoid a situation where Elisa would have to build or fix the repository later on (as happened before with the Unix Shell workshop, when Elisa had to fix the repository content).
               We can create a new one — that’s not a problem.
               As for the confusion, I think it depends. For example, the SQL workshop has stayed mostly the same over the years; only the helper names changed. So it’s easier to copy the previous version and just update the helper names — less effort for everyone. The same was the case for Unix Shell (only the                 name and a few details needed updating), and it’s a similar situation for R (just some name changes and a few more small edits).
   * NMBU’s first Carpentry workshop
     * do we have a page for the course?
     * need to show collaboration between the two univeristy (website?)
     * contact the NMBU library (Elisa)
   * Token and new instructors
     * AVP received a token from the new lot
     * I am assuming CHS received one from the old allocation, but let me know if I am wrong
       * In other words, we have 4 tokens left, is that right?
     * SF should be offered a token, as she co-instructed a WS. 
     * BNW possibility of getting a token for instructor training
       * Q: Did she sign up for co-instructing/helping this term?
   * Regarding following up with new instructors: nobody followed up with AVP before the summer, which resulted in a lost token. We should re-establish the practice of following up with new instructors regularly (like AB was doing at some point)
     * How do we ensure this is happening?
     Notes: AVP instructos token case was followed up to April from My. At that time the plan was that AVP would have taken the course on the following dates.  We normally follow up, but in this case, there was the start of a maternity leave, and AVP was probably not able to attend the course. The token was only valid before summer, so everything had to happen within a very short period of time.

   * CodeRefinery: report from the all-hands meeting (NeIC); collaboration; restructuring the UiO page into a collaboration page, etc.
   * OsloMet: quick discussion
   * Community building & recruitment: how to promote and attract more instructors
   * Note: nobody is approving our minutes anymore. Is that something we want to stop doing?
