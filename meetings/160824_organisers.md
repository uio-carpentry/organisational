# Meeting Minutes #

## Attendees ##

**Present**: Halfdan Rydbeck, Hugues Fontenelle, Sabry Razick (USIT), Karin Lagesen, Lex Nederbragt, Fatima Heinicke, Roza Berhanu Lemma, Anne Fouilloux (in charge of writing the minutes)

**Google hangouts**: Arvind Sundaram, Dmytro Perepølkin

##Adoption of Agenda##

The agenda was adopted and a new item "AOB" was added at the very end (Hugues' additional question on socrative).

##Minutes and action points from last meetings##

**Still pending**: Lex to find a way to share documents that we don't want to put on the internet (github.uio.no can only share with uio not with the world).

**Sill pending.** Follow-up with ForBio: again, Vincent was not present. 

**Still opened** Involvement of local IT-groups (to install SWC and DC software stack). A list of software needs to be defined and given to local IT-groups.


## Oslo instructor training workshop last June/July ##

The Instructor training workshop was a success with about 11 attendees from Oslo  and about 20-25 in total. Everybody learnt a lot, both instructors and attendees!

We discussed how we can have a follow-up to ensure a large number of "fully certified" instructors.

As a reminder (each attendee recieved an email with detailed instructions), to be fully certified, you need (in addition to the Instructor training workshop):

- Make a contribution to a lesson’s content, exercises, or instructor’s guide (for both DC and SWC lessons if you wish to be certified for both)
- Take part in an online discussion session.
- Teach a short demonstration lesson online (a SWC and a DC lesson to be certified for both DC and SWC).

Once certified, instructors need to teach 2 official SWC/DC workshops during the last 2 years.

We discussed how to offer a follow-up to the intructor training workshop. Lex 
mentioned that they were added to our organizers mailing list. 

We have now about 43 names (helpers and instructors + library, etc.) in the organizers mailing list (< 35 actives).

We plan (if possible) to offer another Instructor training workshop at the end of december or beginning of January.

#### Action ####

- Karin will send a follow-up email and offer them the possibility to teach during one of our workshop.


## Fall schedule for workshops##


###Half-day/full-day###

#### 1-day Unix workshop 23rd of August:####

Lex summarized the last Unix workshop:

- 14 students (from his course) + 11 persons.
- They managed to teach the full Unix lesson, including grep and find (but skip a bit of the lengthly lesson 2)
- "Smalltalk - Room 1416" is a great place fro teaching
- This Unix course is an introduction (first part) for attending the HPC workshop organized by USIT in November.


At the end of the workshop, Lex advertised the [HPC workshop](http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/events/hpc_for_research_november_2016.html) and reminded us to advertise the HPC workshop at the end of our Carpentry workshops as it is complementary.

###Two-day Software Carpentry, and/or Data Carpentry workshops?###

November meeting: check if we can have unit testing and SQL (we wait next meeting).

We aim at organizing a full 2-day workshop (Software or Data Carpentry) in November (23-24 November).

We discussed about the content; Hugues suggested to teach SQL or/and Unit testing. We need to check what has to be taught to be a Software Carpentry; for instance, can we call it a Software Carpentry workshop if no python or R are taught? 
If we decide to go for it, we would need to check the SW admin.

Anne also mentioned her wish to organize a workshop on "[Data Management in the Ocean, Weather, and Climate Sciences](http://damienirving.github.io/capstone-oceanography/)"; it is a "contributed" lesson available on the Software Carpentry website. This could be taught in December or early January.

###Organisation###

For the organization of workshops at UIO, Lex discussed with Live and the Library would like to be more involved in the organization. Here is how they could contribute:
- write the minutes,
- pre-workshop/post-workshop registration forms 
- pre-worksop/post-workshop questionnaires (for our non SWC or DC workshops)
- manage the list of attendance
- improve our list of operation for organizing a workshop
- help us to plan the next semester
- help us to make posters and advertise our workshops


Karin suggested 1/2 day internal seminar to train the trainers (socrative, etc.).
 



#### Action ####

- November meeting: check if we can have unit testing and SQL (we wait next meeting).

## UIO carpentry therapy##

Karin re-explained the proposed solution: 

- every two weeks: meet up in the library (with 2 instructors). 
- 5/10 minutes teaching from an instructor (on a pre-defined subject; see [the previous meeting minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/160613_organisers.md "UIO SWC meeting Minutes (June 2016)")). 
- And the rest of the time, we help out.

This first semester is very busy with one-day workshop so we agreed to start next semester.


## Research Bazaar 2017 participation##

See https://2017.resbaz.com/ and https://www.gitbook.com/book/heydejan/resbaz-cookbook for more information.

This year (2016) a Carpentry week was organized and for 2017, we plan to be associated with the Research Bazaar and organize our Research Bazaar festival during the first week of February 2017.


#### Action ####

Lex: Set-up meeting with the library to choose subjects, etc.

## AOB##

- Many of us recieved information about Socrative Pro, a paid solution for [socrative](http://www.socrative.com/question). Hugues wondered if this could have an impact on us. 
  
   Lex replied that Socrative is still free and we can then continue to use it for our workshops.

- Karin suggested to set-up a Google calendar so we can share and get all informed. 

#### Action ####

- Karin will set-up a Google calendar to share.

## Next meeting ##

September 21st at 1pm, informatics building.

#### Action ####
- Sabry will find a room and inform us in due course.
