# Meetings

## Content

In this folder, we store the minutes and other documets of the local Carpentry@UiO community.

When writing minutes, make sure to name the file ``YYMMDD_whosmeeting.md``

Minutes should not contain unnecessary personal information. Make sure you have the consent of those named in the document.

Minutes can be linked from the HackMD notes.

## To-Do
