# Board Meeting of 18.11.2024, 15:30-16:45

**Chair**: DT  
**Minutes**: DT

**Attendees**: DT, FB, MA, DSC/library: EP, MG 
Excused: MLB, LEM

### 1. Update on Carpentry courses and CodeRefinery 
Successful courses this semester with many participants, two courses (UNIX, git) still to go.
Many beginners at the R course, many came from outside UiO. The instructors were required to adapt and slowed down/added repetitions, which was well received.
Code refinery: try to get dates for spring courses early, and organise a local group -- this can serve as advanced courses, rather than organising our own advanced courses (curriculums not mature, lack of instructors). 
FB is interested to get more involved with CodeRefinery. Contact to Sabry (CodeRefinery member at UiO) established.

### 2. Status elections 
- candidates: one self-nominated via email (not known to the board), feedback that several years' committment is too long
     -> _EP_ will ask A. if running for 1y would be an option. _FB_ will ask A. (NMBU). People from OsloMet would be good to have on the board.
- point raised via email: are 2-3 years too long as an elected period? 
  - Election rules and board composition last changed a year ago ([230824](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/230824_board_meeting.md) and [230918 minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/230918_board-meeting.md)), 
      changes need an official request with new charter text and 2/3 majority vote on a board meeting.
  - add an option to be elected for 1y only "upon request"
  - _DT_ will prepare a changed text and circulate for comments
  - online board meeting to vote for changes within 1 week, in time for election
- Several current board members have not attended all board meetings, did not reply to invitations or seem disengaged. Do they really want to be on the board? 
  - _EF_ and _FB_ will talk to them and ask whether they would prefer to resign.
- practical issues: in-person vote may not be the nicest solution if there is competition.
  - set up a webpage with people description, and a nettskjema for voting (majority vote) -> _EP_
  - Send out at least 1 week before Christmas party. -> _EP_
  - Vote closes on the 2nd in the morning, inform elected people before the Christmas event (at noon)

### 3. Plan Christmas gathering
DSC staff will organise cofffee and snacks. Nice if it is not just crisps and cookies, but people could bring something to share. _DT_ will try to make a pie, more people? Try to put that into the reminder email sent out some days before to make it more attractive

### 4. Status on find-more-instructors advertising stunt / How to get more advanced-level carpentry courses?
- 3 new instructors, one postdoc and two PhD students, on-boarding session done via zoom. All are eager to help. One is interested in instructor training. 
- GitHub and Vortex UiO pages & join us nettskjema are updated, thanks DSC staff!
- send out an ad on the MN newsletter in early January in time before the January planning meeting (23.1.) -> _DT_ asks Susann for the dates
- be more present at events: Data science days, bioinformatics week -> add a stand, distribute flyers, sneak in a quick presentation/call for new members/instructors

### 5. Varia 
One candidate selected for this year's instructor training spots, _EP_ will send an invite email.
