**Absent**: 

* Organisational:
  * The minutes of the previous meeting were not approved by anyone. This is likely due to the lack of an email stating they were ready for reviewing.
    * Do we bring such a message back? Do it otherwise?    

* Call for new instructors (3 spots left)
  * Any updates? Did anyone apply?
  * Did we offer a spot to CK?
 
* EP: what do you think about organizing a Carpentry Connect focused on life sciences and applying for this funding from UiO?
    Carpentry Connect: If you're unfamiliar, you can read more about it [here](https://carpentryconnect.org/#:~:text=CarpentryConnects%20are%20community%20convenings%2C%20organised,exchange%2C%20collaboration%2C%20and%20networking).
    Funding Opportunity: UiO is offering event supportâ€”details [here](https://www.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/life-science/news-and-events/calls/2025/event-support-2025.html).

I'm not entirely sure if this is the right fit, but I'd love to hear your thoughts!
