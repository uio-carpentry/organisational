* Organisational:
  * The minutes of the previous meeting were not approved by anyone. This is likely due to the lack of an email stating they were ready for reviewing.
    * Do we bring such a message back? Do it otherwise?
    * AL to implement this from the next time    

* Call for new instructors (3 spots left)
  * Any updates? Did anyone apply? Nobody, the format did not work
  * Action: MLB and EP to spread the word on mailing lists (same used for Data Management Week)
  * Did we offer a spot to CK?
    * EP to follow up 

* NMBU
 * R-club, a former colleague of EP asked about Carpentries at NMBU
  * We could have a meeting with them (group of 3-4 people)
  * UiO has 2 central organised WS which could be given to NMBU
   * Idea: 2 distinct WSs, one SC-oriented and the second (independent) more bioinformatics-oriented
   * Actions: AL to create a poll, EP to follow up as well      
 
* EP: what do you think about organizing a Carpentry Connect focused on life sciences and applying for this funding from UiO?
