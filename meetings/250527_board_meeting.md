**Attendees**: FB

**Excused**:

**Absent**:


* Call for new instructors (3 spots left)
  * Did we get a response from CK?
  * There was somebody who responded. How did this progress?

  * [Link to document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBkhuruIoOAX_1vDArCfsKK76HXoaH5SiScpR41M-rc/edit?tab=t.0)
    * There was some momentum, but things suddenly stopped.
    * There is also a mail *FINAL REMINDER: dScience Support for Researchers at the University of Oslo - apply by May 30th*.
      * Do we want to go through that? Or not? Shall we try to work with the same deadline?
        
* NMBU
 * R-club: A former colleague of EP asked about Carpentries at NMBU
  * We could have a meeting with them (group of 3-4 people)
  * UiO has 2 central organised WS which could be given to NMBU
   * Idea: 2 distinct WSs, one SC-oriented and the second (independent) more bioinformatics-oriented
   * Actions: AL to create a poll, EP to follow up as well  

* Last workshop for the term ended.
  * Considerations? How was this term? What works fine? Do we have a procedure for assessing these things?

* AOB
  * CodeRefinery phase 4 launching mid-May
    * (to my understanding) in-kind contributions from the partners (incl. UiO, probably), NeIC to cover travel expenses.
    * (so this indicates that this continues, although no PMs are covered).
    * [Possible documentation](https://github.com/coderefinery/reports-and-proposals/tree/main/phase-4-proposal)
