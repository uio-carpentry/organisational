1. Annika and Aino are working on the workshop agenda for spring 2022. It will be written up in the spreadsheet when finalized. 
2. We have 8 people taking the instructor training this year. To ensure the candidates receive support during their training period, they are being offered a monthly mentoring hour. This will be held in conjunction with the Carpentries Nordic and Baltic regional community meeting on the 10th of the month.
3. Carpentry@UiO will have a Social Gathering on Tuesday 29 March, 4 pm-6 pm. Hurrah!
4. Lex will work on the preparations for a SWOT analysis of the Carpentry@UiO. 
5. Annika held a presentation of the Carpentry work for the library's leadership group. As the library pays for the Carpentry membership, it would seem only fair to keep the leaders informed of the state of affairs. It was agreed upon to continue the current membership for another year, then take stock of plans. Renewal of current membership is on 1 August. 
6. The meeting with the TASK team is scheduled for Mon 14 March, from 10.30 am-11:30 am on Zoom.
7. After agreeing on new roles for new board members, the role distribution of the elected board members now looks like this: 
* Chair: Lex
* Secretary: Désirée
* Vice-Chair: Mohamed
* Outreach contact: Anne   
* Representatives of the library: Annika & Aino
--> Action point: Redefine the roles on the website.
