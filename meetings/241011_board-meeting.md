# Board Meeting of 11.10.2024

**Chair**: DT  
**Minutes**: MLB  

## Attendees: FB, RS, DT, DSC/library: EP, MLB

### 1. Update on Code Refinery Workshop and Carpentry courses

**CodeRefinery workshop**: held on **September 10-12 and 17-19**. EP and FB attempted to organize a local group at UiO to follow the course together, but the short notice made it challenging. The event was announced on UiOâ€™s web pages and sent to the main organizer and announcement list, but there were **few sign-ups**. There were 3 subscribed people, two of whom decided to meet anyway. 

The contact for CodeRefinery at UiO is **Sabry Razick** from USIT. For future events, we should collaborate with him and *start planning earlier*. FB intends to engage further with CodeRefinery in the future (as time allows).

**Conda and Docker workshop**: This workshop was offered for the **first time**. Some parts worked well, but a few slides and figures were hard to see due to the screen size in the room. Note that the workshop materials are still in the incubator and not officially endorsed by the Carpentries at this stage. We have found some outdated sections, especially in the Docker part. Overall, the workshop was well received.  
Out of **12 registrations**, 9-10 attended. ðŸŽ‰

### 2. Instructor training spots

**Carpentry@UiO** has the Carpentries **Silver Membership**, which runs from *01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025*. This period, we have used **0 of 5** instructor training seats, and therefore we have **5 spots available** until *June 30, 2025* (this date will be put in the YearWheel).

ðŸ‘‰ All board members should now have access to the Google Drive document that shows an overview of instructor statuses:  
[Instructor Status Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZWKY2Q2gTa3kRfcuniMMdaFyp6VrOz913eqCXDUCq8/edit?gid=1795017706#gid=1795017706)

### 3.Updates on the Yearwheel 
We are going to plot in: 01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025,  instructor spots and duration for Carpentry instructor spots. Some other changes have been made by DT. Feel free to add more and look it over.

### 4.Find more instructors
**Most workshop participants** are from HF and SV, as other faculties offer basic coding courses.

**Susann Andersen**, PhD/career adviser at MatNat, is working with DT and believes the Carpentries can offer MatNat researchers valuable teaching experience as **instructors or helpers**.

EP suggests recruiting for **intermediate workshops**, though this will require extra effort since The Carpentries lacks fully developed intermediate curricula.

Understanding what **motivates people to teach** is key. Postdocs, for example, often lack teaching opportunities, and Carpentries can provide this. We should **highlight this as a selling point** in our recruitment efforts.

**EP and MLB** will prepare a 'call for instructors' for **Susannâ€™s bi-weekly newsletter**, which **does not need board approval**.

### The call should include:
- **Short paragraph**
- **Link** to more info on Carpentry instructor/helper roles
- **Emphasize** that PhDs/Postdocs can gain **teaching experience and certification**

MLB and EP will also **update GitHub and Vortex UiO pages** with details about **instructor and helper roles**.
**ALL check these pages** and give feedback about what they think needs to be added.

### 5. Elections

We need more **board members** who are excited and have time to contribute.

**DT and MA** are finishing their terms this year, leaving **two open spots**.

**ALL board members** should think of potential candidates. Currently, we have two names: **Andrea** and **Ada** (both already part of the community). 

#### Carpentry election rules:
- Can be more flexible this year.
- We can send the **call for candidates** not only to the organizer list but also to the **announcement list**, which includes people outside the Carpentry community.
- Weâ€™ve adjusted the tone and rules to make joining the board more approachable.
- Candidates **donâ€™t need to be from UiO**, though consider the logistics if they donâ€™t live in Oslo.
- No pressure â€” **less but motivated people** are always better.
- We want to be **more inclusive**, so opening it up is a way to **recruit and show who we are**.  EP and MLB will send the call to the announcement list with the tone: "If you feel part of the community."

#### Key dates:
- **Christmas lunch**: December 2, 12-14 at DSC Oasen.
- Elections will be held **after the lunch**.
- Remember: **Donâ€™t pressure people** into becoming board members, as happened last year. (Last year, we had to fill four positions. FB and RS were elected.)

We need to **rebuild the community**, and it requires work. Voluntary work is harder to recruit for, so the **new board must make meetings enjoyable**! It just needs to be organized, and more **social** â€” just for the board. The board should be a **power core** that has a **positive impact** on the rest of the community.

We are announcing the **Christmas lunch** and the **election** in the same email. We need to have all the info ready before we send it and have candidates send a brief motivation and introduction to the board email. **EP** will contact **Andrea** and **Ada**. Otherwise, we will send a **call via the announcement list**. Open to everyoneâ€”until now, we've only sent the election email to organizers. Encourage everyone to **come to the Christmas party** via the announcement!

#### Important steps:
- Set a **deadline** before the election.
- Create a **temporary election page** on GitHub or UiO site with a short description of the nominees.
- **Consent** from nominees if their information is published online, or have them agree via email.

EP and MLB will work on this.

-**Board meeting and social**:  
- **Monday, November 18**, pending confirmation from board members who could not join the board meeting.
- **Meeting late afternoon**, followed by **dinner**. DT send an email to the board.
