# Board Meeting of 11.10.2024

**Chair**: DT  
**Minutes**: MLB  

## Attendees: FB, RS, DSC/library: EP, MLB

### 1. Update on Code Refinery Workshop and Carpentry courses 
**CodeRefinery workshop**: held on September 10-12 and 17-19. EP and FB attempted to organize a local group at UiO to follow the course together, but the short notice made it challenging. The event was announced on UiO’s web pages and sent to the main organizer and announcement list, but there were few sign-ups. There were 3 subscribed people, two of whom decided to meet anyway. 

The contact for CodeRefinery at UiO is Sabry Razick from USIT. For future events, we should collaborate with him and start planning earlier.
 
**Conda and Docker workshop**: This was the first time running the course. Some parts worked well, but a few slides and figures were hard to see due to the screen size in the room. Overall, it went well.
Out of 12 registrations, 9-10 attended.

### 2. Instructor training spots
Carpentry@UiO have the Carpentries silver Membership, which runs from 01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. We have used 0 of 5 instructor training seats, and therefore we have 5 spots available until June 30 2025 (this date will be put in the YearWheel).

All board members should now have access to the google drive document which shows an overview over instructor-statuses now -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZWKY2Q2gTa3kRfcuniMMdaFyp6VrOz913eqCXDUCq8/edit?gid=1795017706#gid=1795017706

Need start identifying potential instructor candidates for UiO tokens (fast-track Carpentry instructor courses). Arturo was nominated. **Let’s all brainstorm potential candidates so we can allocate the free spots.**

We need to start to find people that can be relevant for instructor-spots, to give the UiO tokens (fast track in the Carpentry instructor courses). We discussed some people that already can be asked locally. AVP or AS from UB for instance? FB and EP asks. Everybody thinks of names now so we can give away the free spots. 

### 3.Updates on the Yearwheel 
We are going to plot in: 01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025,  instructor spots and duration for Carpentry instructor spots. Some other changes has been made by DT. Most have filled out dates, but feel free to add more and look it over. 

### 4.Find more instructors
**Most workshop participants** are from HF and SV, as other faculties offer basic coding courses.

**Susann Andersen**, PhD/career adviser at MatNat, is working with DT and believes the Carpentries can offer MatNat researchers valuable teaching experience as **instructors or helpers**.

EP suggests recruiting for **intermediate workshops**, though this will require extra effort since The Carpentries lacks fully developed intermediate curricula.

Understanding what **motivates people to teach** is key. Postdocs, for example, often lack teaching opportunities, and Carpentries can provide this. We should **highlight this as a selling point** in our recruitment efforts.

**EP and MLB** will prepare a 'call for instructors' for **Susann’s bi-weekly newsletter**, which **does not need board approval**.

### The call should include:
- **Short paragraph**
- **Link** to more info on Carpentry instructor/helper roles
- **Emphasize** that PhDs/Postdocs can gain **teaching experience and certification**

MLB and EP will also **update GitHub and Vortex UiO pages** with details about **instructor and helper roles**.

### 5. Elections
We need more members of the board, good people.UB and MatNat faculty all that is left of boardmembers. 

DT and MA are finished in the board this year. We need everybody to find new people run for the board. 

Its difficult to have follow the Carpentries elections - list, the rules are a bit strict. We changed the tone and the rules to try to reach broader and make it more low-key to join. The board candidates can be independent from UiO, so if you know someone that could be interested thats not fraom UiO thats fine (mind that physical presence can be difficult if they do not live in Oslo).

Board candidates suggestions: AW  and AK (already part of the community). EP asks if the want to be listed as board-candidates in the upcoming election. 

Christmas lunch: December 2, 12-14 at the DSC Oasen. Elections after christmas lunch. We shouldnt press people to having to be a board member.
 
Last year we were few and had four positions to fill. FB and RS was elected. 

Now: We want people to know the Carpentry community and what it is all about. Not forcing in general. Less people but with motivation is always better. 

We have to rebuild the community, we just have to work on it. Voluntary work is harder to recruit. 

New board: Must make it pleasant at meetings! just needs to be organized. more social, just the board. Shold be a power core - that makes postive impact to rest of community. 

We are announcing the Christmas lunch and election in same email. We must have all info ready before we send, and have people who want to be part of the board send a mail to board with brief motivation and who they are. EP contact AW and AK, otherwise call to anouncement email. Open for everyone. Until now we have only sent out the elections email to organizers. Come to the christmas party, via announcement!

We want to be more inclusive, so we open it. Its a way to recruit, and to show who we are. EP and MLB send to announcement. "If you feel as part of the communinity" - tone.

Deadline before election, temporary election page on github with a short description of the nominees. Remember consent from the nominees if information on them is published online or just have them say yes with the same email, to consent to the profile. EP an MLB will work on this.

Board meeting and social: Monday November 18, meeting late in the afternoon, meet for dinner right after.
