# Board Meeting of 11.10.2024

**Chair**: DT  
**Minutes**: MLB  

## Attendees: FB, RS, DSC/library: EP, MLB

### 1. Update on Code Refinery Workshop and Carpentry courses 
Coderefinery was September 10 - 12 and 17-19. This was organised on a very short notice by EP and FB. The event was announced on UiOs web pages and registered to main organizer, but very few subscribed. On a better note; we now have a new contact from Coderefinery UiO,so that we can plan better next time! Sabry from USIT is the contact. We have to collaborate next time. Sabry was eager, next time he can be asked to help if we organize but much earlier.
3 subscribed, then 2 after the form closed. Senior engineers, and they worked together. 

Conda and Docker: First time running. Some parts were better than others, but overall good. Some slides not good, some too small figures etc. not so popular.
12 subscribed, 9-10 in attendence, which is decent.

### 2. Instructor training spots
Carpentry@UiO have the Carpentries silver Membership, which runs from 01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. We have used 0 of 5 instructor training seats, and therefore we have 5 spots available until June 30 2025 (this date will be put in the YearWheel).

All board members should now have access to the google drive document which shows an overview over instructor-statuses now -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZWKY2Q2gTa3kRfcuniMMdaFyp6VrOz913eqCXDUCq8/edit?gid=1795017706#gid=1795017706

We need to start to find people that can be relevant for instructor-spots, to give the UiO tokens (fast track in the Carpentry instructor courses). We discussed some people that already can be asked locally. AVP or AS from UB for instance? FB and EP asks. Everybody thinks of names now so we can give away the free spots. 

### 3.Updates on the Yearwheel 
We are going to plot in: 01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025,  instructor spots and duration for Carpentry instructor spots. Some other changes has been made by DT. Most have filled out dates, but feel free to add more and look it over. 

### 4.Find more instructors
We need more members of the board, good people. Most of the peolpe coming to our workshops are from HF and SV. UB and MatNat faculty all that is left of boardmembers. 

SA: PhD/researcher career adviser at the MatNat faculty. Currently works with a project targeted especially for researchers. Notices that they reported much stress. DT also involved in the project. SA got interested in what the Carpentries offers. She is sending newsletters every 2nd week with often useful stuff, and we can put our workshops there, and a call for new instructors. Short sentence - with a link thats all the space we get. Carpadmin are in contact with her about this. EP and MLB wrote a short one, which is in the agenda. We can recruit from there, try to target more advanced and intermediate workshops.

We need people that want to to intermediate workshop, but this requires much work. We need to find out what motivates people to come and teach. Postdoc for instance dont get to teach - Carpentry can make this possible, so we need to find a good way to use this as a selling point in the promotion/recruitment. 

EP and MLB will work on this and send directly to SA every second week since we agreed that we do not need to send it to board for appproval first. 
"Want to teach? Join the carpentry community! - send something like this to SA and include in the newsletter. MLB and EP will also update the GitHub and vortex UiO page to fit more with what we discussed and send to board for insights.

### 5. Elections
DT and MA are finished in the board this year. We need everybody to find new people run for the board. 

Its difficult to have follow the Carpentries elections - list, the rules are a bit strict. We changed the tone and the rules to try to reach broader and make it more low-key to join. The board candidates can be independent from UiO, so if you know someone that could be interested thats not fraom UiO thats fine (mind that physical presence can be difficult if they do not live in Oslo).

Board candidates suggestions: AW  and AK (already part of the community). EP asks if the want to be listed as board-candidates in the upcoming election. 

Christmas lunch: December 2, 12-14 at the DSC Oasen. Elections after christmas lunch. We shouldnt press people to having to be a board member.
 
Last year we were few and had four positions to fill. FB and RS was elected. 

Now: We want people to know the Carpentry community and what it is all about. Not forcing in general. Less people but with motivation is always better. 

We have to rebuild the community, we just have to work on it. Voluntary work is harder to recruit. 

New board: Must make it pleasant at meetings! just needs to be organized. more social, just the board. Shold be a power core - that makes postive impact to rest of community. 

We are announcing the Christmas lunch and election in same email. We must have all info ready before we send, and have people who want to be part of the board send a mail to board with brief motivation and who they are. EP contact AW and AK, otherwise call to anouncement email. Open for everyone. Until now we have only sent out the elections email to organizers. Come to the christmas party, via announcement!

We want to be more inclusive, so we open it. Its a way to recruit, and to show who we are. EP and MLB send to announcement. "If you feel as part of the communinity" - tone.

Deadline before election, temporary election page on github with a short description of the nominees. Remember consent from the nominees if information on them is published online or just have them say yes with the same email, to consent to the profile. EP an MLB will work on this.

Board meeting and social: Monday November 18, meeting late in the afternoon, meet for dinner right after.
