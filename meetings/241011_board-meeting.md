# Board Meeting of 11.10.2024

**Chair**: DT  
**Minutes**: MLB  

## Attendees: FB, RS, DSC/library: EP, MLB

### 1. Update on Code Refinery Workshop and Carpentry courses 
Coderefinery was September 10 - 12 and 17-19. This was organised on a very short notice by EP and FB. The event was announced on UiOs web pages and registered to main organizer, but very few subscribed. On a better note; we now have a new contact from Coderefinery UiO,so that we can plan better next time! Sabry from USIT is the contact. We have to collaborate next time. Sabry was eager, next time he can be asked to help if we organize but much earlier.
3 subscribed, then 2 after the form closed. Senior engineers, and they worked together. 

Conda and Docker
First time running. Some parts were better than others, but overall good. Some slides not good, some too small figures etc. not so popular.
12 subscribed, 9-10 in attendence, which is decent.

### 2. Instructor training spots
Carpentry@UiO have the Carpentries silver Membership, which runs from 01 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. We have used 0 of 5 instructor training seats, and therefore we have 5 spots available until June 30 2025 (this date will be put in the YearWheel).
All board members should now have access to the google drive document which shows an overview over instructor-statuses now -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZWKY2Q2gTa3kRfcuniMMdaFyp6VrOz913eqCXDUCq8/edit?gid=1795017706#gid=1795017706
We need to start to find people that can be relevant for instructor-spots, to give the UiO tokens (fast track in the Carpentry instructor courses). We discussed some people that already can be asked locally. AVP or AS from UB for instance? FB and EP asks. Everybody thinks of names now so we can give away the free spots. 

### 3.Updates on the Yearwheel 
Put in: end of june instructors carpentry. Some changes made by DT. Most have filled out dates, but feel free to add more and look it over. 

### 4.Find more instructors
We need more members of the board, good people. Most of the peolpe coming to our workshops are from HF and SV. UB and MatNat faculty all that is left of boardmembers. SA: PhD/researcher career adviser at the faculty. Currently works with a project targeted especially for researchers. Notices that they reported much stress. DT also involved in the project. SA got interested in what the Carpentries offers. She is sending newsletters every 2nd week with often useful stuff, and we can put our workshops there, and a call for new instructors. Short sentence - with a link thats all the space we get. Carpadmin are in contact with her about this. We wrote a short one, which is in the agenda. We can recruit from there, try to target more advanced and intermediate workshops.
We need people that want to to intermediate workshop, but this requires much work. We need to find out what motivates people to come and teach. Postdoc for instance dont get to teach - Carpentry can make this possible, so we need to find a good way to use this as a selling point in the promotion/recruitment. EP and MLB will work on this and send directly to SA every second week since we agreed that we do not need to send it to board for appproval first. 
"Want to teach? Join the carpentry community! - send something like this to SA and include in the newsletter.
MLB and EP will also update the GitHub and vortex UiO page to fit more with what we discussed and send to board for insights.

### 5. Elections

Desiree and Mohammed are finished. we need everybody to find new people run for the board. 
the hybrid meetings are falling apart - feels better and more efficient to meet everybody.
its difficult to have a list, the rules are a bit strict, we changed the tone and the rules. just find a candidate.
more flexible, better to have one good candidate, but what if they do not at all know the carpentry community?
independent form UiO. can be anyone actually. outside - problem, never physical present...
Andrea very good candidate! we ask. 
Ada would also be great.
