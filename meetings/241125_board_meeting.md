## 1. Changes of the charter
At the last board meeting desired adjustments of the Carpentry@UiO charter were discussed. 
Proposed changes were circulated to all board members six days before the extraordinary board meeting, for review and comments. A pull request was created with four requested reviews, which were approved by EP, MLB and MA. FB suggested a few additions to the proposed changes which were discussed and added under general agreemend during the board meeting. The board members voted on the final charter text and approved all changes with a 100% majority, with six board members (all attending) approving the changes, and zero board members not approving.

To publish the changed charter text the board agreed on the following steps: FB adds the additional edits approved at the extraordinary board meeting, DT reviews and merges the pull request. The changes will then be visible on the Carpentry@UiO github page and are effective immediately, including the 2024 (this year's) election.
