## Agenda points and notes

The purpose of this meeting was to welcome the new board members and make for a smooth transition with the leaving board members. 
At the election in December 2023, two new board members were elected (present), but two more places still need to be filled.

Ragnhild sent out an email inviting more people to join the board before this board meeting. Three new potential board members replied to Ragnhild's email. EP is following up with them. 
If two confirm interest, we can invite them directly. If three, we may have an election event during the social event in February.

Overview of what should happen this year, and what the board's duties will be: "Ã…rshjul" seems never to have been made. RS takes care of this.

CarpentryCon in 2025: realistic to organise? Decide together with new board members. Could be together with DSC days. 
Useful contacts if we want to go for it: people from monthly calls (currently dead), CodeRefinery, people we know in Bergen etc. Lex has been on a CarpentryCon before and might 
be happy to contribute. FB is also teaching carpentry workshops in Bergen and can be a good contact point.

Carpentry Nordic Branch monthly call: start them up again? RS would be interested, maybe together with the new DSC hire (expected for later this spring/summer).

Courses spring 2024: python, R, SQL, Unix, mostly very late in May/June.
We are so far missing git, send out another call to organisers for this course specifically.
USIT no longer plans their courses for each semester, so less need to coordinate. ASB will still feature as the contact person.

Next meeting: ASAP with the new board members, preferably in late Feb (MA not available early March). FB is in charge of finding a time slot as soon as the new board members
are elected.
