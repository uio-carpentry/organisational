## Board election in the Fall (2021): Strategy and dates

- 2 new board members will be elected for 2 years.
**When:** In the Fall (September). 
**Action:** Leading up to the election, board members should reach out to potential candidates via e-mail and/or network and be informative about what a candidacy and board membership entail. 

## Hosting a Carpentry@UiO Social Gathering 

- In the hope that the current "situation" will look different after the summer, we aim for a Carpentry@UiO social in the Fall. Here, we can inform about plans ahead, exchange ideas for future activities, stage a quiz event and strategically spread the word about upcoming elections.  
**When:** August (except during "Fadderuke" - week 33 - 16-20 Aug)
**Where:** Blindern campus (we hope----)
**Action**: Ahead of the gathering, exchange ideas and draft main points for a strategic plan to be presented. 

## Carpentry membership issue
- Still awaiting info 
**Action**: Await further info (from Naoe)

## Future organization of Carpentry workshops
- Naoe has raised the question of hosting a Centrally-Organized Workshop. These events are organized for a fee and were hosted on earlier occasions. 
**Action**: Elaborate on the point of workshop organization in general, especially in terms of involving DSC to a greater extent. 
- Matthew Good to be invited to the next board meeting to discuss DSC-Carpentry@UiO workshops.
