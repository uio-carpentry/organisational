**Absent**:

## 1. Following up on Action Items

* Discussion: I (FB) feel I do not have enough of an overview of the completion stages of action points (and there is usually quite some time between board meetings).
  * Would it be OK to set up GitHub Issues on action points for monitoring a bit more closely and follow-up? Or shall we consider other solutions for this?
    * How many are favourable to GitHub Issues?
    * How many against?
    * How many are abstaining from voting
    * Note that we can similarly vote also for alternative solutions and see which one of them has the largest amount of preferences.  

* Send token to NB
  * Did this happen?
    * If it did happen, did the communication officer (EP) get in touch to verify how comfortable he is with the process?
* EP to draft a collaboration proposal and share it with the board (dScience, IT, etc.).
  * Do we have a draft for this? I think this should get some priority. Do we know if they intend to participate in the [Data Management Week](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/dsc/2025/data-management-week-2025-.html) in March and how they intend to contribute? 
* Initiatives to use the MatNat mailing list more actively for promotion.
  * Any updates here? 
  * It would be good to be both on:
    * ecr-mn-news@nyhetsbrev.uio.no
    * nyhetsbrev-editor@mn.uio.no
  * Do we have other channels? 
    * There is in principle cbo-all@usit.uio.no (FB subscribed). This is not a newsletter, it is a mailing list for announcements, which could potentially be used if we decide to have calls for new trainers or similar.
    * Other options?
* Promote "open day" participation for Carpentry@UiO.
  * Any updates here? When is this initiative taking place? (Does anyone have a link for this) 
* Explore collaboration with NMBU, especially in bioinformatics.
  * Comments here?
