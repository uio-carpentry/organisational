# Board Election Meeting Minutes, 20-02-2025

**Chair**: FB

**Minutes**: MLB

**Attendees**: FB, LM, MG, EP, MLB, AP

**Excused**: RS

**Absent**: NF


## 1. Important

* We probably need a strategy to get new instructors. It is my understanding that we have 5 tokens, 2 of which have been used (AVPDL, NDYB). We need to fill out the three spots before June, could we come up with some names? This also links with reaching out to other UiO parties.
* We will try, and we have to think further. Maybe use the spots stretegically when we reqruit, for instance to dScience? Or open call - with deadline. A different approach, must be a little careful, but we must be a little aggressive to get more people. Not too dangerous. Everybody agreed on the approach. 4 new members/interest in 2025. Zoom - welcome call tomorrow. Also; keeping new members interested longer. Try to not lose them. 
* EP and MLB: Make event, nettskjema, send out with deadline and link to official Carpentry page with dates. 

  * Also, the [dedicated spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZWKY2Q2gTa3kRfcuniMMdaFyp6VrOz913eqCXDUCq8/edit?gid=1094759204#gid=1094759204) was not curated in the latest period. Do we still keep it? I feel taking care of this is part of the role of the communication officer (EP).
  * EP: This spreadsheet is now updated.

## 2. Following up on Action Items (from [previous board meeting](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/250123_board_meeting.md))

* Discussion: I (FB) feel I do not have enough of an overview of the completion stages of action points (and there is usually quite some time between board meetings).
  * Would it be OK to set up GitHub Issues on action points for monitoring a bit more closely and follow-up? Or shall we consider other solutions for this?
    * How many are favourable to GitHub Issues? Everbody present agreed. 
    * How many against? None present.
    * How many are abstaining from voting None.
    * Note that we can also vote for alternative solutions and see which one of them has the largest number of preferences. No alternatives were presented. 

* Send token to NB
  * Did this happen?
    * If it did happen, did the communication officer (EP) get in touch to verify how comfortable he is with the process? 
* EP to draft a collaboration proposal and share it with the board (dScience, IT, etc.). EP made updates to a folder in the Carpentry-drive. She also made a draft. What are we asking for? Are we overlapping, or maybe just a meeting? Yes, a meeting. We have similar portfolios, discuss this together, maybe collaboration.
* Link to document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBkhuruIoOAX_1vDArCfsKK76HXoaH5SiScpR41M-rc/edit?tab=t.0
* EP away for defense. Back March 17. EP can initiate, but FB can follow up email correspondance. Otherwise, maybe we just wait til EP gets back. No rush. Fine to wait, busy for everyone. After Data Management Week (March 24 - 28). 
  * Do we have a draft for this? I think this should get some priority. Do we know if they intend to participate in the [Data Management Week](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/dsc/2025/data-management-week-2025-.html) in March and how they intend to contribute?
  * They are not involved. Some issues from DSC, we didn't start early enough. Busy period, and IT, dScience, must be involved at the beginning of the planning. 
* Initiatives to use the MatNat mailing list more actively for promotion. 
  * Any updates here? 
  * It would be good to be both on:
    * ecr-mn-news@nyhetsbrev.uio.no
    * nyhetsbrev-editor@mn.uio.no
  * Do we have other channels?
    * There is in principle cbo-all@usit.uio.no (FB is subscribed). This is not a newsletter, it is a mailing list for announcements, which could potentially be used if we decide to have calls for new trainers or similar.
    * Other options?
    * https://www.uio.no/for-ansatte/enhetssider/med/aktuelt/med-nytt/2025/04/ Med-Nytt. weekly, for instance. Already Data Management Week is included. 
* Promote "open day" participation for Carpentry@UiO.
  * Any updates here? When is this initiative taking place? (Does anyone have a link for this) 
* Explore collaboration with NMBU, especially in bioinformatics.
  * Comments here? BF feels it would make sense to start from the actual core workshops...
  

## 3. Discussion points (from [DT's living document](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/agenda_points_living_document.md)) 

* Revise the list of active community members on the web pages
  * How to proceed? Email?
* How to handle empty board seats? (I personally feel we can't do much handling at the moment, we need to work on expanding the community in the first place, see also points above on mailing lists and interaction with dScience and USIT - FB)
* Are further changes to the charter needed
  * (I feel this is much related to the point above and a bit useless to discuss now)
* Add data collection consent to course sign-ups
  * discussed already in 2022: we would like to know who is attending our courses, see [221213 board meeting minutes](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/221213_board_meeting.md)
  * What is the status here? How is this different from what is typically done for DS Days? EP: We always ask for consent in the Pindena-form. Finding a way to delete/store this information. 
  * If we have this information and it looks useful, shall we try to have a meeting with the instructors to discuss it?
 * 0 of 2 Centrally-Organised workshop(s) organised this year. To schedule a workshop, please submit a workshop request form at least 2-3 months before your desired workshop date. Workshop benefits will be forfeited if they are not used before the end of the membership.
   * Can someone come up with more details here? Do we even want this? Could this be a way of getting more action? Or would it just be a repetition of what we provide already with more overhead? Opinions?
   * It costs a little. We must provide board and travel for instructor. Maybe not so beneficial for us. Better to use our own resources. 
   * Re-start Study group with a focus on AI
     * This is already happening at the library and RS is involved. We could come up with something else if necessary, but what? How did this work in the past? What did people find useful? (I feel our interests are a bit too fragmented, it is not straightforward to find something that would make everyone happy - FB)
